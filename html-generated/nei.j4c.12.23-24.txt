      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
     
      <p>Yesterday afternoon Joseph Pulitzer came in for a half hour's talk, his purpose being to let me know that he is delighted with the column and wants me to stay. I knew this, of course, for things come to me regularly; but Pulitzer was like a big brother. I told him, when he asked if I was happy in the job, that I was worried only by the fact that I have no time or vitality for my big work. He asked if I had any suggestion for a change that would remedy the trouble. I told him that later I might have a suggestion. He said for me to come to him any time I had anything on my mind, and he'd be glad to discuss it with me. He does not want to go back to the weekly page. He is sold on the daily column. He said that six months is a very short time in which to succeed on a new newspaper feature.</p>

      <p>Now here is the funny thing. While he was talking to me like this, the boy came in with a big letter from the Alber Bureau, which contained a contract for two years - 40$ of gross receipted to me, no engagement for less than $200, all expenses, advertising, railroad fare and pullman, to be paid by Alber.</p>

      <p>I can't feel justified in leaving the P-D this fall, when I consider that it is late to book for the coming season, and that this job will bring me $5980 next year (counting $5 per week for books sold). It pays $5460 this year. Pulitzer also informed me that I am entitled, as a member of the editorial staff, to three weeks vacation on full pay.
    
    <div class="note">To this should be added $500 for lectures I've agreed to give next fall &amp; my royalties.</div>

    I have the Alber contract in my pocket. It's pretty alluring. But I think it would be better to sign up for the winter of 1928-<del/>29, and 1929-30. Thus Alber could have plenty of time to work up big business.</p>

      <p>How does this strike you?</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With endless love,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>
      <p>I believe that with the peace of mind the situation gives me I can plan to take the 6 A.M. train to St. Louis every morning, work two hours here at the office on the Messiah, and begin my colum work at 9. This would shove me ahead, and I can work every morning during the three weeks vacation.</p>
