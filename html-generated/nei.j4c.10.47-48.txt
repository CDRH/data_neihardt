      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:-</span>

      <p>I've asked Macmillans to send you their Fall Announcement catalog. It contains notices of my two books, but that is not why I'm sending it. I want you to note what is said about the new and greatly enlarged trade edition of the Modern Readers' Series. Note that it's edited by Thorndike. I have agreed to let them include FRIENDS - GLASS. This is a pocket edition for the public that is not reached by the regular trade editions and is to be promoted in a special way. I suppose, of course, that you will be named as editor of my volume. The school edition is to go on in the schools, and they assure me that it will be pushed steadily.</p>

      <p>Gosh, I hope Sat. Review will take your article! If you were a smart alec and not a genuine appreciator, there'd be little reason to doubt. But, as it is, the thing may go through. I do want it to go through.</p>

      <p>Everything going finely. I'm still reading proof by the mile. Must make an extended trip in October, beginning when, I don't know yet. I am too uneasy, as a result, to write the opening lines of the MESSIAH; but they are there, and I'll be truly happy when the thing starts.</p>
