                <p>During the past three days I have been hungrily reading your <u>Hamilton</u> — a fine experience; and I am most grateful to you. I wish you had put your name on the fly-leaf; but perhaps you will do so next summer.</p>

                    was what was the matter with me when I was a Socialist. It has been the same with me in the conception of all values, from those of common sense up through esthetics, ethics, religion.</p>
               
                <p>You've done a lot of good, Aly. Many thanks!</p>
