      <span class="salute">Dear Mott:</span> 
      <p>I've just seen your review of P.V. in The Sat.
Rev. of Lit. <u>Bully</u>! You
certainly did it generously and I'm grateful. That
will help a lot.</p>

      <p>You'll be glad to hear that my stuff shows a
very considerable increase in sales this year. <u>Indian Wars</u> went into a new
edition in March - making three, counting the de
luxe. The school edition of Friends-Glass   made the biggest advance yet. I'm
greatly encouraged.</p>

      <p>When are you going to take a vacation here in
these beautiful hills with us? You are, of course,
invited - <u>you</u> meaning
the family too. I have a car &amp; could show you
around.</p>
