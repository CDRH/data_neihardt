      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
  
      <p>See article in September <u>Bookman.</u>
      </p>

      <p>On Aug. 22nd, the N.Y. Eve. Post Lit. Review published my reply to the question, "what is the most beautiful line in English poetry". It appears also in Phila. Public Ledger.</p>

      <p>Don't forget the opening paragraph I outlined for your Sat. Rev. article. Keep the article <u>toned down</u> well below the level of pangyric. You can say all you want to say &amp; do it in the lower tone. I do not say this with the least intention of criticising anything you've written heretofore, but merely as a precaution in


dealing with the Sat. Review. I want you to get in there. Say what you want to say, but continue the pitch. <div class="note">Be wise as a serpent--your <u>suave</u> way. <u>You know. But say it all too, and as one having authority.</u>
         </div> Did you have a chance to poke around in any representative Chicago bookstores by way of learning how they are stocked with the <u>Wars?</u>
      </p>

      <p>If I could get someone to finance you for 5 yrs, you could travel the country &amp; put the cycle into thousands of schools. And think of the money constantly, being spent on bad booze! Golly! what a world. $30,000 would put the American Epic Cycle over with the rising generation.</p>

      <p>We work through a <u>crude, crude</u> medium, alas!</p>

         <br/>Jno.
