                <p>Thanks for the invitation to be a guest in your home after June 8. I will return from Yankton about June 7, and then I can come to you for a week or more. I think this is a good plan, as it will save you much coming and going. I do hope, however, that we may be at Skyrim once or twice. If we give our time to the job, much can be done in even one week.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>Alice &amp; the children will be leaving (with a load of horses) next Wednesday. (This is Sunday). I'm glad I can tell the children I'll be coming down to them in a short while.</p>
              
                <p>I'm reading the MS — Chap IV. <u>Good job</u>! Two or three corrections as to facts — easy to make. Will pass the MS on to Dr. Reid.</p>
