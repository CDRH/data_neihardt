      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:â€”</span>


      <p>Here are three Sterling poems for the Pack. Please see that I get the manuscripts back. As you note, they are signed by Sterling. I have a large collection of his signed manuscripts and want it to be larger.</p>

      <p>You can get the dope for his life-sketch from Who's Who, of course. If Scollard sends you one or two poems, rush them to the printer without sending to me.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>J.G.N.
</span>

      <p>Sterling says in his letter: "It is understood, of course, that the Seymours acquire no rights in the poems by using them in the Pack". This is satisfactory to you, no doubt.</p>
