                <p>I suppose I'll receive a letter from you soon, but in the meanwhile here is a note that I don't want to forget. Perhaps you know Mark Sullivan's <u>Our Times</u> which appeared in 6 vols and covered events in the U. S. from 1900 to 1925. It's well known. In the volume dealing with the early years of our century, he spoke in passing of the thrill he &amp; others felt when my lyrics were being published (The Bundle, The Stranger, Man-Song). You will want this, as it brings back an <del/> authentic echo from that time, and
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    few there are who remember. I do not know Sullivan except by reputation.</p>
                
                <p>I'll send letters later about the telecourse. It surely <u>is</u> getting <span class="unclear ">over[?]</span>, and there's a lot of enthusiasm scattered about . I <em class="hi">hear</em> so much, and I'm told that, according to a survey made by television people, each <em class="hi">letter</em> represents 500. Lambert says 1100. <del/> The brass hats seem happy about the affair. Next semester I'll <del/>have classes again.</p>
               
                <p>I miss you.</p>
