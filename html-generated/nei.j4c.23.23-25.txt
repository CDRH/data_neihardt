                <p>No doubt you remember the letter I did <u>not</u> write you in reply to the good letter you 
                    <u>did</u> write me? Well, this is that letter â€” the one I did not write you sooner! I hope everything is now clear! I was very glad to hear from you, and I approve the plan you
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    have for spending your money on a copy of my book. If you have the book when I come, I will write in it.</p>
                
                <p>I gave your message to Robin, and I believe he will write you. I should think it would be fun for you two to attend school together.</p>
                
                <p>Only two weeks from this day Robin and I will be flying to Oregon!</p>
