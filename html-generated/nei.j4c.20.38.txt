                <p>I've just received the copy of your McCurdy letter. Since H. S. Latham left Macmillans about two years ago I have had no close contact with anyone in the company.

                    <ul>
         <li>1. Letters to Latham over many years</li>
         <li>2. Letters to his predecessor as Ed.-in-Chief, whose name I have forgotten.</li>
      </ul>
                   <p>These would be of general value.</p>
                
                <p>Do see Herman Hagedorm at the old Theo. <del>Rose</del> Roosevelt house. He, I'm sure, could help you with introductions.</p>
                
                <p>Good hunting!</p>
