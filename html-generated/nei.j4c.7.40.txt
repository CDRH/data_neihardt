      <p>You must have received proofs of <u>The</u> 
         <u>Pack</u> by now.</p>

      <p>It has struck me that perhaps you were thinking of including Trombley's focus on Columbus. I would favor including it if the lines I marked can be shaped up in time. We could drop a short poem somewhere to make room. I'm eager to have as much good or promising stuff in the <u>Pack</u> as possible.</p>
