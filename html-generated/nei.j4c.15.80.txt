                <p>Just a word to say that I'm happy about your Nov. number. The Robinson article is a shrewd and really penetrating bit of criticism, I believe. Fair and kindly, too. It's a bull's eye shot, no doubt.</p>
               
                <p>And the installment of the Sentimental Journey is corkingly good, with the note in it I wanted to hear.</p>
                
                <p>The book has aroused a lot enthusiasm. Macmillans have written me 3 urgent letters, asking to publish it. They heard of it by accident. Amusing.</p>
