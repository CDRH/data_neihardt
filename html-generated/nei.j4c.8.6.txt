      <span class="salute">Dear Mott:-</span>

      <p>I've seen your article in the Register. Good work! I am glad to have it said that I do not pose. In fact I haven't any platform manner. If my poetry is worth hearing, I win. If it is not worth hearing, I lose.</p>

      <p>It seems that the committee wants, or thinks it wants, a miscellaneous program<del/>, some lyrics, some of the "Friends", some of the "Wars". There's the spirit of modern America. What do you think? Should I give all the time to either the "Friends" or the "Wars", 
    
    
    
    or should I give a taste of one of the narratives and fill out with lyrics? Think this over, keeping the audience in mind, and be prepared to advise me. Please.</p>

      <p>I'm eager to see you again.</p>
      <span class="closer">

      <p>The lyrics always get across, for that matter, and I like to read them! But isn't the epic the thing now? And I judge that the audience will be unusually intelligent.</p>
