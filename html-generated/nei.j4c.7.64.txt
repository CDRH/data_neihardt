      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>



      <p>"Home again, never more to roam again" — no, I'm off again in late Jan., I am pretty sure to see you on my way to N. Y.</p>

      <p>Rec'd the <u>Pack</u>. Corking! Am a bit worried over the "Address". Some errors in proof, rather nasty ones; but you may have caught them all.</p>

      <p>Have had bully time at colleges &amp; universities of the West &amp; Northwest. Made some Bookfellows, I hope, at least, a number promised to send a dollar. I've made several heretofor.</p>

      <p>Rev. Chas. F. Chapman of Butte will join. He's a regular fellow &amp; has written a big bunch of mighty interesting lyrics. He read to me for two hours. Has never published. I wish, after you get his dollar, that you'd ask him to send you a representative bunch of his stuff. He has enough really bull little things to make a spiffing little book. Please try him out and oblige me.</p>

      <div class="note">
         <span class="unclear missing">[?]</span> I'm not strong on preachers; but Chapman is only an Episcopalian! He doesn't preach his verse! And he loves life.</div>

      <p>Everything moves my way, apparently. Even my publishers congratulate me. A taciturn breed of animals, as a rule!</p>

      <p>Good luck to you in everything. I'm due to sleep in that room this winter!</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>
         <br/>John Neihardt
