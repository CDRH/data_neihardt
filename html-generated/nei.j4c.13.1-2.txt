      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Judging by the enclosed, Macmillans seem to be getting a bit wormy for the Notes and Maps, but a little delay will hurt nothing.</p>

      <p>As to the bulk of the Notes, I told them they might count on forty pages like those in the Friends-Glass Notes. When you've finished, you might want to run through the MS, cutting out any notes that, in view of the completed work, might seem to be less than necessary. Don't worry about typing. Enid likes to do that and she is fast and dependable.</p>

      <p>Walter Locke is in charge of the editorial page of all the Cox papers. Address him at the Dayton News.</p>

      <p>The All-America Movement is moving faster and faster. It may do things. Looks very exciting now.</p>

      <p>Boni and Liveright want me to do the Cooper chapter in their Writers' History of American Literature. I will if I can get time. Country Gentleman wants a series of articles on country life. Encyclopedia Britannica wants articles on the Missouri and Platte Rivers.</p>

      <p>I am neglecting my vineyard certainly. In a century or so this may be better understood.</p>

      <p>When I made that remark about the Lindbergh poem, I was not thinking of the poem's quality.</p>

      <p>I signed up with Penn. State College for five days in August -- $500 and entertainment.</p>

         <br/>Jno.
