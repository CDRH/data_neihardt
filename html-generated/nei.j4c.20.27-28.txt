                <p>I just want to say hello and to tell you I still feel the fine glow of my visit with you. (I wrote you shortly after I reached home.) This has been a busy time, getting all the grades lined up. I have a remarkably efficient grader, who left me nothing to do but to check his work. Now I'm off until mid-Sept.</p>
                
                <p>We are doing a lot of building, which will continue several months. One <del/> barn, 16'x28', is about finished, and next we'll begin 
                    
                    
                    on an indoor riding barn, 100'x30', which will run north of the big barn and be a part of it.</p>
                
                <p>Several times in the first gray light of morning I've wakened and thought of you, Nita, <del/> on a "bird-walk", <del/> and often I've seen again those magnificent water-falls and the long vistas you showed me, Slade.</p>
                
                <p>Bless you both!</p>
