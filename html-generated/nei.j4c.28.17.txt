                <p>I'm ashamed and sorry!! The copies of <u>Easter</u> are only now being sent, and I fear they may not reach Ithaca before you leave; but, anyway, they <del/>carry affection.</p>
                
                <p>Alice, Lynn, and Erica are back home to stay! They've moved their horse business back, and the home is alive again!! They made good progress down south, but they (and I) had <del/> 15 horses here that were being neglected.
                
                
                           
                
                and on expense. We now have some of the best horses I ever <del/> saw â€” one of these a stallion that you <em class="hi">must</em> see.</p>
               
                <p>I'll be thinking of you out in your Pacific Paradise. Bless you, dear Brother!</p>
