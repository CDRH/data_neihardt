                <p>Many thanks for your letter!</p>
                
                <p>Of course I'll be glad to do whatever you want me to do, and you may feel free to use me as you wish.</p>
                
                <p>I had planned to fly back on Thurs., but I think there is still time to change the return date. I'll try at once, and let you know whether I can return on Saturday.</p>
                
                <p>I've arranged to fly by United Air Lines leaving
                    
                   
                    
                   
                    
                    Kansas City at 2:20 p. m. on  Feb. <del/>20, and arrving in Portland at 8:05 p. m., your time. This will be <em class="hi">flight 547</em>.
