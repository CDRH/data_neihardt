      <div class="note">Born in Kentucky, author of 36 books and nearly 3,000 poems; known as the Keats of Kentucky for his Romantic evocation of natural world.  Earning an international reputation, Edmund Gosse selected the verse and wrote the introduction to his collection, Kentucky Poems; his work was recognized by Pres. Theodore Roosevelt with an invitation to the White House (1905); his friendships included Kate Chopin, E. A. Robinson, Oliver Wendell Holmes.
    
    In 1913, he published a poem entitled “Waste Land” in Poetry magazine in an issue that also contained an essay by Ezra Pound.  Said to have influenced T. S. Eliot’s 1922 work, “The Waste Land,” (which is often identified as the beginning of modernist poetry), Cawein’s work also drew deeply upon Anglo-European literary allusion and classical mythology.  Unlike Eliot, however, he wrote in traditional verse form.</div>
