      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>

      <p>I am a sadly disappointed man. For weeks and weeks I have been looking forward to the discovery of a shocking number of large and juicy errors in the ADDRESS, and I am unable to locate any though I have fine-combed the thing with great meticulosity. This seems hardly kind.</p>

      <p>There is, I am glad to say, one error in the record of the notification ceremony - Mr. Reed for Mr. Brown. You will note the correction in the copy forwarded you today. Even this error fails to give me the expected thrill, for I am almost certain that the mistake was made in manuscript.</p>

      <p>You astonish me when you ask for the rejected "Pack" poem. Good gracious, Man! Those were surely sent to you months and months ago. I have not forgotten your shameless hectoring, and I'm almost willing to swear that I sent the package to you. Look around and I'll do the same here; but I think you'll find them there.</p>

      <p>What a bull little book the ADDRESS is! I refer to the makeup, not to the lecture.</p>

      <p>Did you note what I said about Rev. Chapman of Butte? When you find time, I wish you'd ask to look at his verse.</p>

      <p>Is there much dissatisfaction over the "Pack"?</p>
