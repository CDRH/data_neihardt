                <span class="salute">My dear Senator Norris:</span>
           
                <p>Shortly before his death, my <del/> friend Dr. W. E. Sealock, wrote you a letter in which he set forth his <del>side of the <span class="unclear ">[controversy with?]</span>
         </del> side of the trouble with the Board of Regents of the University of Omaha. <del>After <span class="unclear ">[his?]</span> Dr. Sealock's</del>
      </p>
                
                <p>After his death, as you are doubtless aware, the Board finally issued <del>a statement <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del> a statement by way of "explaining" its action. I <u>am</u> one of those who know that the statement was absurd &amp; tragically unfair, and I am writing to <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[ask?]</span> if Dr. Sealock's</del> suggest that Dr. Sealock's statement to you be <del>made</del> given to the public. <del>Recently, my paper, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, wired Mrs. Sealock asking for a copy of the statement but, of course, it could not be given. Omaha</del> along with other friends of Dr. Sealock, I have thought that you might be willing to <del>read the statement <span class="unclear ">[give?]</span>
         </del> run the statement <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[to?]</span>
         </del> in the Congressional Record.</p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>
         <del>From what I know of the case, I should say</del>
      </p>
                
                <p>From what I know of the case I should say that <del>the public needs to know</del> a public airing of it would be a good thing. There is every indication that the Board wishes to <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> hush</del> have the matter hushed up; and it does seem outrageous that such a shadow should be allowed to remain on the memory of such a man as Dr Sealock.</p>
                
                <p>I hope I do not seem officious in venturing to write you about this matter. <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[Had it and please?]</span>
            <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del>Were I in the habit of thinking of you as merely <del>a Senator</del> another Senator this letter would not have been written, for I <del>have no "influence" with no political</del> have no political influence, <del>I <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del> and don't want any. I am <del/> just a human being writing to one whose high humanness has become proverbial; and I am one of many who feel deeply that the public should know Dr. Sealock's side of this <del/> tragic affair</p>
