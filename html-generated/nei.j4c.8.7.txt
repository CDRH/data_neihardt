      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>

      <p>I'm back again, for how long I do not yet know. Send on the Masefield book. It hasn't come to me from the Journal yet.</p>

      <p>I'm ashamed to say that I've found the Pack manuscripts. It was singly hidden away in a box of letters. Some of my wife's doings, bless her! I'm sending <del/> it on.</p>

      <p>If the <u>Address</u> is ever revised by the bookfellows; be sure to let me make some slight changes &amp; an important addition. You ought to sell 500 easily enough. I'll send a short list of names. It's a pity the thing wasn't advertised by the Merchant Club.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. Neihardt
