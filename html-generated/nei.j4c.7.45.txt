      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>



      <p>Here's the bibliography. I have given only the books. It would be a deuce of a job to run down all the stories and poems that appeared in various <del/> magazines between 1900 and 190<del/>8 when I quit<del/> writing stories and lyrics and settled down to the epic cycle. At one time (1907 and '08) my short stories were in great demand, and there were quite a number of them. I'll leave the complete story of the earlier period to be worked out by some chap lucky enough to outlive me.</p>

      <div class="note">OK</div>

         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>J.G.N.

      <p>You have doubtless received the supplementary matter I sent — ? The Niehardt Club will issue a Face Bulletin, which will doubtless contain a notice of the publication of the Laureate address. Perhaps you might care to send copy to Dr. J.T. House, Wayne, Nebraska. He's a Bookfellow, you know.</p>
