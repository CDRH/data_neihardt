      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>
         <u>Are</u> you sick? I'm really worried. I have not learned yet whether or not you have received <u>Black Elk</u>, and I wouldn't have you think I'd neglect you of <u>all</u> the people in the world. I ordered one sent to you to save time, &amp; upon hearing from you intended to send the usual autograph copy for your own.</p>
                
      <p>Everything looks promising here. <u>Messiah</u> moves on &amp; I'm afraid it's beautiful, with a great sad glory ahead.</p>
                
      <p>Wish I could see you. Am hoping to have a month or so on the high prairies this spring <del/>or summer, or both.</p>
                
      <p>N. Y. Times will have a fine illustrated article tomorrow (the 6th). Saw advance copy of it. John Chamberlain wrote it &amp; did a good job. I've encountered some meanness &amp; a bit of green eye so far, but that's expected. Also, much ignorance playing temporary Indian expert; but that is only a matter of pathetic necessity! The poor guys have to live. <div class="note">(Some <u>strong</u> reviews too.) On the whole am quite satisfied.</div>
      </p>
