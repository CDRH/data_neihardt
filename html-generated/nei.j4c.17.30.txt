                <p>That is a dear letter and it does me good. I feel in it the same glow that I used to see in your face--and want to see it again.</p>
                
                <p>I think Simon &amp; Schuster would be better than Macmillans--far fewer publications, more cleverness in promotion. I hope they'll want the book.</p>
                
                <p>Homer's book is a joy. I'm so glad about it.</p>
                
                <p>No more now, but this carries the old gratitude and love, dearest comrade,</p>
                <span class="closer">
                <br/>Jno.
