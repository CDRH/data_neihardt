      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Davis:â€”</span>

	     <p>I have just sent another Indian story to Mr.
Titherington. It seems to me considerable better than my average,
and I have asked that it be considered for the Munsey alone.
I wished to write you about this, fearing that you might not
understand me. I want you to know that I have not been
dissatisfied with the manner in which any of my stories have
been judged by you people. I have made the request mentioned
in connection with this story because I am afraid that the 
subtle meaning in it would be overlooked by more readers of
the All-Story than of the Munsey.</p>
	     <p>With me, writing is both a business and a passion, with
the accent upon the latter. I want to see those stories which
contain the most of me, in a position to reach the people
who will most readily understand.</p>
	     <p>If you were personally acquainted with me, you would 
see just what I mean.</p>
	     <p>I am glad to have Narcisse in the Scrap-Book. I like
that magazine more and more. As I think of it now, the first
version of that story was rather rank. But I am not one of
those who must study a lesson many times before it is learned.</p>
	     <p>I hope to see you within two years; and if it is in the
spring that I come, you shall take something on me.
Always remember that the sentiments expressed in the verses
in which I drank to you, always hold good with me.</p>
      <span class="closer">

			      <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
