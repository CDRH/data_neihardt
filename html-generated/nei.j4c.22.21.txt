                <p>I'm wondering if you may be sick, or if a letter was lost here.</p>
                
                <p>Bob Kelly died several days before election. He was <del/> running for state auditor. A fine man, and a friend.</p>

                <p>the great old and lamented Boston Transcript. His long article on <u>Glass</u> was the best that appeared. He is still living. Only recently he issued some anthology: If you should write him, asking him to comment on the matter, I believe you would get something you could use, â€” <del/>something of the "time-mood" that can carry over only through personal reminiscience. You'd know how to express your desire.</p>
