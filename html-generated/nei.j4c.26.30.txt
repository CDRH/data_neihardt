                <p>I have nothing new to say, but I feel an urge to tell you I am thinking of you and that you are dear to me.</p>
                
                <p>My classes are a source of pleasure, as usual. Our weather is perfect â€” golden days and colored leaves, with a tang of frost.
                
                
                
                    
                
                I'm writing this at Skryim, which I don't like to leave; but I must have the water shut off and the pipes drained.</p>
