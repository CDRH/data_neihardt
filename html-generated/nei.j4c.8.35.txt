      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>
         
      <p>Please send a copy of Doctor Neihardt's famous lecture to me at
    3022 So. 34th St., 
        Omaha, Neb.</p>

      <p>I'll <span class="unclear ">[remit?]</span> when I reach home one of These Times. Am giving the middle west a treat. On my way to a college at Aberdeen now. I understand that the <span class="unclear ">[folks?]</span> up there haven't done a ton of work for a week - everything shut down in expectation of my appearance.</p>
      <span class="closer">
