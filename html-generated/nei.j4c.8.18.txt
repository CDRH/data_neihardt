      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>

      <p>I am so fond of Dr. Neihardt's <u>Laureate Address</u> that I have already read up the ten copies of it. Enclosed find check for two more copies which I shall also read up. Before reading the Doctor's <u>address</u> I was a <span class="unclear ">[constantinious?]</span> reader of Shakespeare and Rev. Harold Bell Wright. Them two was my <span class="unclear ">[voda mercurus?]</span>. How I find it impossibilous to read Shakespeare a tall. This I consider high praise indeed.</p>
