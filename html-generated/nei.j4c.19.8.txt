                and Mrs. Graves:</span>
                
                <p>"The Song of Jed Smith" was finished on April 16th, and so the <u>Cycle of the West</u> is completed as planned 28 years ago. The new book will appear in the Fall, and the complete <u>Cycle</u>, in one or two volumes, will probably be published next year.</p>
                
                <p>I've felt moved to share this bit of family news with two faithful ladies whose warm-hearted interest means a great deal to me.</p>
