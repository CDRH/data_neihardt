                <p>Many thanks for the stationery! I'll use it wherever I think it may do some good to the Order.</p>
                
                <p>Also, many thanks for the pleasant words in the Step Ladder.</p>
                
                <p>I suppose you'll be getting away from Chicago soon! I'm leaving here on the 17th, to be in and about the Adirondacks until middle July.</p>
                
                <p>I like to think of you two, and of the time we spent with you.</p>
