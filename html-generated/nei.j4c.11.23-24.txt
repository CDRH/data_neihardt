      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I was eager to hear from you after your trip to Washington, but you "didn't say nothin" much about it. Perhaps it is hard to tell what you got on the book, since I've been out of touch with the developing work.</p>

      <p>Yes, I'll do that you ask. You bet! Wouldn't it be well to get some good novelist to do something too? I might help to land one. I wonder why Willa Cather wouldn't do something. She would, knows her job. I'll help if you say so, tho' I've met Willa only once.</p>

      <p>Glad you didn't get bowled over by the typo errors in the earlier numbers of my page. Bad ones - damn it! I roared &amp; they began sending me proof several weeks ago, some still creep in, but not bad ones any more.</p>

      <p>I'm mighty glad to hear that you itch to get at <u>Man and Poet</u>. And by they way, read, the two new volumes in Macmillans, English men of letters Series - "Swinburne" and "<del/>Melville". The first is a masterpiece of biographical writing and of criticism. Really a wonderful piece of work. It will inspire you. You can not <u>yet</u>, of course, go into the matter as deeply as the author of "Swinburne" does. I'm still alive. But - you'll be inspired <u>as to form</u>, and you have the enthusiasm for the material already.</p>



      <p>I've made further progress on <u>Messiah</u>. This week - good stuff. Last week, nothing, as I had four men's work and a lecture to boot.</p>

      <p>I enclose a letter from Sherman. I can show it to you and Judge, but you will understand it's only "in the family". Judge said something about "cannibalistic culture" and swore he'd not see one in that place. It is funny, Doctor, the way they run around with their little knives sticking each other in the dark. Poor Avery has had no great fun in that job, I suppose! Please return the letter.</p>

      <div class="note">And Sherman is my friend. Also, I'm his. Also, I admire Alexander's work, and he has been very kind to me. It is a queer mix up!</div>

      <p>Now the odd thing is that <u>Alexander</u>, the enemy of Sherman et al., is secretly my very strongest backer for a position there, <u>as I know positively</u>. It is precisely <em class="hi">he</em> who has been starting all this. <u>I know</u>, for I kicked, and was advised to know nothing and wait.</p>

      <p>
         <u>Well</u>, Comrade, I want nothing that is in Lincoln.</p>

      <p>
         <del/>You won't tell any of this, I know.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Lots of love,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>
      <p>The whole bother at Lincoln has been notable for a sour smell of hayseed parsimony, and my friends are not to blame. It's the former legislature they all fear.</p>
