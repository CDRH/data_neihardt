                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
            
                <p>I did not get it all said in my letter yesterday. <u>I never do</u>, for that matter.</p>
                
                <p>First, I am glad about the Review and the Neihardt program you have been asked to give. I know how fine they will be, and how I wish I could hear them!</p>
                
                <p>Then, I'm moved by what you tell me of Mrs. Skillings. How dear of her to want to do something for John's old pal! Yes, I'll be properly <u>surprised</u>! But before you told me, I was thinking about that bare home with so much trouble in it, and no light ahead, except the
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    religious light, which I'm sure Mrs. S. has. I was thinking about this with a little heartache and wondering what I could do; if in any way I could slip a little money into the family purse without giving offence — or better still —without their knowing where it came <del/> from. Maybe I could try to buy that fine piece of work she showed us — at a premium price. I 
                    <em class="hi">do</em> love beautiful needle work and <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="skillful​ &#xA;    ">skilful</a> patient hands.
                    But what could I offer? How could I go at this business? 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Can you suggest a way? I wish I could buy the afghan at a 
                    <u>really good</u> price; but that couldn't be done under the circumstances.</p>

                <p>This was written at the University yesterday, and just now I have the good news from you that Bower came home on Wednesday. Hello, Bower! I'm so glad you are at large again, and I can see you sitting in that parlor, happy to be with Lucile and Stewart. I just came too soon; but better too soon than never!</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>Yes, Lucile, I am happy about the program you will give, and the plan is a good one. I <u>wish</u> I could be in your audience. Maybe some day I shall be (So the "nice old gentleman" who clipped your hedges thought you were "a nice lady". That makes two <del/> of us, and it's unanimous. But it <u>was</u> gracious of you to feed the "college boy", as well as pay him! Many thanks for your work on the lawn and patio of my "second home". I appreciate your thoughtfulness. <del/> I'll bet it's beautiful there. Soon my granddaughter, Nina, will be running our power mower again. She is my standby — very conscientious.</p>
                
                    <p>Yo-Yo went with Hilda to a B &amp; W meeting lately, and was a perfect lady. The President had "the evening's guest" introduced to the other <del/> ladies! No more room! Bless the three of you together!</p>
