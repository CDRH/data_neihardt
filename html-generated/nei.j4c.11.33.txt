      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>The enclosed should have been mailed some days ago. Thought it had gone.</p>

      <p>John Macy writes long fine letter, saying I was only one who got his point in his World Literature, and praising my "long-standing achievement"; begging also that I <del/>"add to my fragrant laurels his poor devoted thanks". He is putting me in his new school book. Also Payne of Tex. U. is putting me in his new school book. Also <u>The Texas Outlook</u>, which goes to 22000 teachers, is boosting my stuff for schools - very devotedly.</p>

      <p>It moves.</p>

      <p>Well, Amy got the Prize, no surprise to me, and no disappointment. She is dead in two ways.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Endless love</span>

         <br/>Jno.
