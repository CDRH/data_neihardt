                <p>I've just returned from roving in the West with Dr. Lucile and Dr. Bower Aly. We had a wonderful and profitable time looking up places where I've lived. I'll tell you when you arrive, and I'm <u>so happy</u> you are actually coming on the 28th!</p>
                
                <p>Bless you!</p>
