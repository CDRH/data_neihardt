      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I can hardly believe that I have not written many letters to you, for in the confusion of the past weeks - new surroundings and duties and moving the family - I have so often talked to you in imagination? I wish it could have been in fact. Things are beginning to move here, I think; and my page a sort of clearing house for Western opinion - I'll be on the road going somewhere. Famous authors, and have valuable articles the P-D gets for nothing. I'll send you my next page - the 4th here.</p>

      <p>We have a nice home at 460 N. Harrison Ave, Kirkwood, Mo - 25 minutes by the steam cars from the P-D. You will visit us during the holidays. Hooray! Hurrah! And we'll get in the Buick and go out into the woods somewhere &amp; have a talk-fest all alone. When are you coming?</p>

      <p>
         <u>Indian Tales</u> have had some powerful reviews. The N.Y. Times &amp; N.Y. Eve. Post especially powerful ones. <u>Collected Poems</u> should be out any time now. Three weeks ago I signed 500 sheets for the autograph edition.</p>

      <p>Yes, I hope you can get at The <u>Man and Poet</u> soon.</p>

      <p>I love you, dearest Comrade - and always shall.</p>
