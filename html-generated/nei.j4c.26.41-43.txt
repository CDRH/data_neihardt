                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                
                <p>This is not a letter, and you must not hold it against me that I seem to be writing out of turn! This is only a note. I want to tell you something before I forget. (You and I must be awfully careful about such things).</p>
                
                <p>Well — about stories &amp; poems from 1901 to 1914 not collected in books:<br/>
                    
                    Around 1906-07 <del/> the Outing Magazine published stories of mine with illustrations by Schoonover, <span class="unclear ">Jay Hambidge[?]</span>, etc. Have you looked those up? I recall <u>The Epic Minded Seat</u>, <u>The Dead Man's Dog</u>, <u>The Brutal Fact</u>, the latter  being <del/> a first telling of the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> shooting
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        incident. You will want to look up the Outing stories. Caspar Whitney was editor then — <u>a great editor</u> of his day. He sent me down the Missouri River to write eight articles on the trip. (This is 
                        <u>The River and I</u>.)</p>
                    
                    <p>Then <u>do</u> you know <u>To a Hat Pin</u>, published in Truth 
                        (<u>a high-class magazine</u>) along about 1902? (Lucile, this one is a lark!! It was all about the girl with the long golden hair who lived across the street — Edith Perdel! <del/> We used to go on skating parties. <del/> Bitter cold nights.
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        big fires!)</p>
                
                <p>And <u>have</u> you seen <u>The Tiger's Lust</u>, a long short story published in the old Philadelphia <del/>Ledger about 1902-03? If you haven't seen <u>that</u> one, Lucile, you aint seen nuttin' yet." (It bought my mother's false teeth — her first.)</p>
                
                <p>There was an obscure but hopeful little magazine along about 1903-04-05 that published a sketch of mine, called <u>The Hot Wind</u>, a memory of my <del/> experience in Kansas when I was 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    five <del/>and six. I can't remember the name of the magazine, or even where it was published. And do you know 
                    <u>The Wind God's Wooing</u>? This was printed in colors on our Bancroft Blade press. Spenserian stanzas, I remember — wow!!</p>
                
                <p>I enclose the letter from old Rex's nephew! The high prairie <del/>wind, the dust, the shattering rain and the coffin being lowered!! O Lucile, dear friend, in the short view it's a most pathetic business, isn't it?</p>
                
                <p>Rex was delighted over his correspondence with you.</p>
