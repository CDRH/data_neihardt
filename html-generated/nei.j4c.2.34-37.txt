      <span class="salute">Dear Old Man:—</span>


      <p>After you left I had a slight touch of homesickness, or something like it. Unusual for me. I am little given to lonesomeness. I am still enjoying your visit — it grows.</p>
    
      <p>Nora May French's volume arrived, and I have devoured it. My favorite is the sonnet with the line "always the out hall is very still", but throughout I find a strangeness that lyric poetry, or any poetry for that matter, should have. What a face that creature had! I know what you mean about her looks by lamplight.</p>

      <p>Smith sent me his volume, as you requested. Will write about it later. Am very glad to have it.</p>

      <p>Things are looking up about here. The cave &amp; the back bedroom are finished &amp; I have had some cement walk laid. If I am not careful I shall find myself

<del>living</del> living in a palace! "Hugh Glass" forges ahead steadily. Am just getting to a bully adventure with three others waiting. Since you left, I have hit upon a new bit of epic material — or maybe ballad material.</p>
    
      <p>I almost wish I had bored you with that Glass stuff of mine.</p>

      <p>So <del/> yearns for <del/> — ? Evidently she is not looking for an honest man! I hope she gets whatever she is hunting for! Of course it is platonic. I believe it always begins so.</p>





      <p>What did you do in Ann Arbor? How did you find your admirer? I mean <span class="unclear ">[Hyatt?]</span>. Did you meet Sam Lockwood?</p>

      <p>It was kind of you to remember Mona in Chicago, &amp; she appreciated your thoughtfulness.</p>

      <p>Old man, I wish you &amp; I  could take a couple of ponies &amp; disapear into the little Missouri country — go through the bad lands that Sully crossed with an army corps, pass through the Slim Buttes region &amp; follow Crook's line of retreat in the Sioux Campaign of '76. I wonder if it will ever be possible for us to bat around together like that for awhile. You would get as much out of it <del/> for your work as I for mine &amp; probably more in the end.</p>
 
      <div class="note">I'd like to be hungry &amp; thirsty with you.</div>

      <p>Whenever you want to make me very happy, just write me that you


have started on the <span class="unclear ">[Lillith?]</span> poem. Big idea &amp; made for you. I have thought much of it once you told me. No more now.</p>

      <span class="closer">    
         <span class="salute">Always affectionately,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>

      <p>Old man, you are still on that pedestal. Luck to you up there!</p>



      <p>xxxxx Their kisses for Uncle Sterling.</p>
