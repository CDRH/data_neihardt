                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                <p>I don't believe my last letter deserved your curtsey — certainly not the court kind. I can do a lot poorer letter than that one, and I may at any time. <u>This</u> may be <u>it</u> for all I know.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks for regarding me as a good zizzer! I'm especially good when I'm headed northwest. Golly! (am 
                <u>I</u> zizzy <u>then</u>!)</p>
                
                <p>Yes, I'll talk to Bower about the placing of papers and letters. I <u>do</u> wish Missouri <u>could</u> and <u>would</u> go the limit on preserving the material, because this <u>is</u> the mother of the West; M. U. was the first university in this country; and I'd love to be identified
                
                
                
                
                with this region. My roots have all been in this Middle West. Still, I do not want the papers, <del/> letters etc. to last only a few years.</p>
                
                <p>With your biography <del>and</del> as well as the other work you will do, precious Lady; with the papers located here; and with whatever may be remembered of me (<u>if anything</u>), there could be a damned good story hovering around here! A good story needs a focal point, and this seems to be the logical spot. But I <u>will</u> talk to Bower, and I <u>do</u> know his advice will be good. Maybe he
                
                
                    
                
                
                can suggest some way to <u>insure</u> the proper handling of material here. If I <u>can't</u>, be sure, Lucile, I'll think seriously of the Congressional Library. (The others are Titusville, Penn., the Newberry Library (Chicago), Buffalo Memorial Library — <u>and</u> Huntington, as <del>
            <span class="unclear ">you[?]</span>
         </del> you once suggested.)</p>
                
                <p>I sent the <del>
            <span class="unclear ">horse[?]</span>
         </del>horse pictures to old man Stewart because I wanted him to see some <del/> famous sisters of <u>my</u> sweetheart filly, <u>Creation's Queenie</u>,
                
                
                 <u>(also Queenie's famous papa),</u>
                
                who will soon be going away to boarding school!! The other day she and two other sweet horse friends of mine, came to the gate for a visit with me. They thrust their pretty heads through the gate, each eager to have all the petting. 
                <u>They did not fight</u>, because they are friends; but they <u>did</u> want a lot of loving. <u>Queenie</u> pressed her velvet nose against the middle of my face and held it there a long while. She is small, svelt, perfectly formed, <del/> 
         <u>full of love</u>, — and 
                    proud!</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>It's interesting about the pedestal. The theory is right certainly. The other day I was at the Swap Shop on Hy 63 south and there I saw a pedestal about 4 1/2 ft high, maybe 5, but I think it is about 4 1/2. I did not examine it closely, but it looks like mahogany and is a well-made piece of furniture. Funny if it were the one you've been hunting!! Shall I examine it and report to you?</p>
                    
                    <p>Yes, you should wash my dirty cement face and paint me. Off-white or creamish would be all right. Or maybe a <u>hint</u> of pink would help at a little
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    distance. But when I get there, Lucile, I'll take one swift glance and tell you at once how badly you have done! 
                    <u>Just like that</u>! That new desk must be a darb! Who planned it, and of what wood is it made, or to be made? <u>And</u> the books arranged with reference to the frequency of their use! Bully!</p>
                
                    <p>I'm so glad you know what to do about your broncial troulbe, and I hope the "strong medicine" you mention will control the trouble while it is being cured. But, nice lady, please don't become allergic to this poor old man! If you begin to sneeze when I arrive, I'll have
                    
                    
                        
                    
                    
                    to turn around and zizz right back.</p>

                    <p>Indeed I never did use Schoolcraft's Indian stuff in any way!</p>
                
                    <p>I know Van Wyck Brooks only through some of his work. I seem to recall that he mentioned me, not without respect, in a footnote; but he <del/>was not the sort who 
                    <u>would</u> know <del/> and care for my work. I was not happily impressed by his <u>Ordeal of Mark Twain</u>. It seemed impudent, to me, and I have no respect for Freudian criticism.</p>

                    <p>The title, <u>A Bundle of Myrrh</u>, is from the Song of Solomon (King James version). And what a marvelous erotic poem that is! What an expression of the beauty and divine madness of mating! <div class="note">The Modern Readers' version is very good. Makes the poem more intelligible.</div> And to think that the orthodox would insist that the poem is concerned with Christ and the church! The poor sourpusses! How much of the wonder of life they had missed!</p>
                   
                    <p>Rambeau apples were well known when I was a boy in Missouri. They were late Fall apples and had very rosy cheeks. They seem to have been forgotten — like the Russets! (Incidentally, the latter grew on the lot where your house was later built <del>
