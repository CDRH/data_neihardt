                <p>I believe you had a real experience that grew out of a heightened state of <del/>consciousness induced by the music, and I think the implied advice is wise. I have felt little enthusiasm for the task of <em class="hi">rewriting</em> 
                    <u>Poetic Values</u>. I've felt there could well be omissions and additions here and there. 
                    <u>So we are in agreement</u>. Isn't there something gloriously reassuring about such flashes of insight? I had one yesterday while waiting in the hall of the Journalism School for my television committee to come.

                    It had to do with the illusion of <del>Time</del> the Time concept and the eternal Now that I mentioned in The Child's Heritage. Only I didn't realize the probable meaning of the expression when I used it. Yesterday for about a half hour I 
                    <u>knew</u> in an overwhelming way. It was good, good! I may work it into Poetic Values where it would fit beautifully, even logically. <u>We are</u> prisoners of that illusion, certainly; but <u>not forever</u>.</p>
                
                <p>There are many intimations that can teach us if we watch for them.</p>
