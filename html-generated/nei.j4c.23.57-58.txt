                <span class="salute">Dear Stewart:</span>

         <p>This is what she dictates to me. Anyone proficient in canine linguistics should be able to translate it for you. Roughly, without the deeper meaning, it <del/>reads something like this: "Hi, Stewart! How're you doin'
                
                
                 
                
                
                over there? Do they give you plenty of pettings and dog-food? Affectionately, Yo-Yo."</p> 
                 
                 <p>She speaks a very special dialect, and so much escapes between the arfs.</p>

                <p>We're having weather!! Snow yesterday, alternating with drizzle. A <u>thunder</u>storm last evening —
then more snow through the night! The highways are a mess this morning; but I must get out to the TV station this p. m. and I will, I'm sure. I'm giving this week to <u>The Messiah</u>, and I love it. The thing <u>is wise far beyond me</u>, and it's beautiful. Bill Mackie, who is in charge of my program, glows when he talks about it. He &amp; his wife
                
                
                
                
                really get the meanings. I can give only three sections — The Coming of the Word; Wovoka's Vision; and Wounded Knee.</p>
                
                <p>After this week I'll cease to twinkle, twinkle little star! I'll miss the experience. Next <del/> time we'll probably have 1 hour periods, and that will be bully.</p>
                 
                <p>Robin and I will see you three in Feb. if the planes fly — and they will. Perhaps by that time there'll be an unseasonably warm spell — violets and dandelions and robins.</p>
