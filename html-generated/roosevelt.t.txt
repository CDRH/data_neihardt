   </h3>
   <p>
      <div class="note">26th President of the U. S., leader of Progressive Movement, whose history of military and  political involvement (war in Cuba, Rough Riders, Bull Moose Party etc.) is well-documented.   He developed a love of nature and outdoor adventure and activity as a child recovering from poor health and asthma.  Widowed at a young age, he ranched in the Badlands of South Dakota and later, North Dakota, and became well-known as an outdoorsman who championed the conservation movement, adding to national forests and setting aside lands for public use.  He was also, however, a big-game hunter who took thousands of animals as specimens, with little benefit to science.
    
    Author of over thirty books, he kept up an enormous correspondence with contemporary intellectuals, political figures, family and friends.</div>
