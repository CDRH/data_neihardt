                <span class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly:</span>
            
                <p>I want this to reach you before you start for Minneapolis. I had an office in the old Journal bldg on 4th St from Sep 1, <del/> 1912, to March 1 (I believe) 1913. During this time I ran a weekly page. After that I did my work (a <u>weekly</u> column) in Bancroft, and, after 1921, in Branson. Be sure to go over the <u>weekly page</u> first. There must be some amusing ones in this group, as I recall how old H. V. Jones used to come into my office chuckling to say, " Well, you had another hot one!" I remember "Sentimental Geometry" and 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    "Wanted: A Barrel of Arnica"; but there must have been a considerable number. I think there may <u>be</u> some on the outburst of impressionism in 1912. That would be the early beginning of my thesis which was elaborated in the Journal-Post and, most of all, in the Post-Dispatch.</p>
               
                <p>You mention my "reading" to the children. It was <u>recitation</u>. I used to "sing poetry" to them, as they called it. "Sing poetry, Daddy; sing poetry". I did a lot of that.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>Did you find the verses to Davis, ending "Of you, 'tis, I'll be thinking when I blow off the foam"? I vaguely recall those you mention.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Yes, you certainly are right about <u>Mignon</u>.<del/> Nature knows nothing of morals — an obvious fact that in no way lessens the social value of morality or the spiritual value either. Beneath the troubled surface there are the unchanging depths — the universal mother — the <u>"Ewige <del/> Weibhichkert"</u> (Goethe's
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    expression). My <u>A Vision of Woman</u> is on this theme. I assumed the Indian felt this instinctively and experienced something of the old, old, worship.</p>
