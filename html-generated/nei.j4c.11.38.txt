<span class="salute">Gentlemen:</span>

      <p>Three years ago in May your body did me the honor of conferring upon me the title of Professor of Poetry in the University of Nebraska.</p>

      <p>I have learned that friends of the institution have recently expressed themselves as favoring my appointment to an active position. While sincerely appreciating whatever feeling of the sort there may be, and grateful as I am to your body for the honor conferred, I am compelled to offer my resignation of the honorary position, and to ask that you make your acceptance known to the public, that there may be no further thought of the matter. Duties recently assumed would make it impossible for me to accept an active position at the University if one were offered. The honorary connection can be of no value to the University, and might now prove an embarassment to me.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very truly yours,</span>
         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
<br/>John G. Neihardt
