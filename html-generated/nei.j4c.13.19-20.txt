      <p>I am to read for Dana Hall Sunday, November 11th, Wellesley, Tuesday November 13th, and Boston City Club and Boston University within two or three days of these dates. Could I get to Boston for Sunday evening engagement if I should stop with you for Friday stunt?</p>

         <span class="salute">With love always,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
