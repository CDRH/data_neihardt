                <p>I <u>am</u> wondering if you <u>are</u> sick. I hope not. Your last letter was dated Oct. 14.</p>
                
                <p>Dr. McCurdie will be in today to give me <u>my</u> copy of the dissertation. I'm eager to have it, you know!</p>
               
                <p>One of these days you may have a list of questions for me to answer on tape.</p>
                
                <p>I've just heard that kinescopes will be made of <u>Fetterman's Fight</u>, <u>Beecher's Island</u>, and The Death of Crazy Horse. <u>Jed Smith</u> seems to hit especially hard. I don't <del/> quite know why.</p>
