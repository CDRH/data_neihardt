      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:-</span>

      <p>Well, here you are in Montgomery! Welcome home! It will be that shortly, for you are sure to be a part of the wall of the things <del/>in short order. You are going to make them know that somebody has come, and they are going to have an English Department. It will be bully to have only the job of making an honest-to-goodness department, without a lot of other duties. Golly, I'm eager to hear all about it! I wrote you at Wayne, but it is probable that the letter didn't catch you, for no doubt you were off early on that auto trip to Chicago.</p>

      <p>Here's a point. In that article for The Saturday Review, emphasize the national character of the Cycle. You know that a lot of pseudo-lyrical pifflers, with nothing whatever to say, are played up as poets of distinction. It's really very funny. There is almost no able criticism in America. What should be shown now is the fact that there is a body of national poetry growing up, making little noise, thanks to the idiotic din of the cliques, but getting into the general consciousness of the country most surely. There's an idea I do want you to get in. You know how to be exceedingly <del/> suave - it's one of your gifts. Say it, without rubbing vinegar and salt in the wound! It can be said in a very few sentences, in passing. Perhaps in the introductory passage - maybe in the concluding passage. I favor the latter, since that is the point you want to rub in 
   
<div class="note">- din of the cliques". I wish you could use the expression. Thousands are getting sick of the cheap tom-tom beaters - deathly sick.</div> 
    
    
    
    I've just heard from Marion Clyde Wier again. He is the same old fan - stronger, if there has been any change. He says he thinks he has read the Friends more than any English book, and that it seems greater now than at first. Also, he says that Aeschylus and Homee would give the book a place on their reading chair". He's at Brown University, as you know; and he is growing weary of the East - "a rock-bound coast and a hide-bound host", as he puts it. Says he is growing "numb", and quotes a passage from Aristophanes (in Greek) to the effect that his <del>but is</del> 
         <del/> bottom is beginning to ache - "algein archouai ton orron!" That cuss must eat Greek. He's full of quotations and keeps me jumping around when I get his letters. I've caught his curves thus far, but may muff one at any moment. I judge he's a queer but very likeable man. Bless the queer now and forever, amen! He wants to come west. Is getting $4,000 at Brown, but wants out - longs for more open country, freer life. I thought of your old job at Wayne.</p>

      <p>Will it not be great to see your article and name in the Lit. Review? Hurrah!</p>

      <p>You're gone, but you don't seem far away at all. You seem very close.</p>
