                <p>What a fine-looking family, and what's better, fine as you look! Mona and I were genuinely pleased to have a look at all of you. Many thanks for remembering us.</p>
                
                <p>"The Song of Jed Smith" is nearing completion. Macmillans have wanted it for May publication, but any dead line would stop me. So it will definitely appear in Sept. I should be through in Feb.</p>
                
                <p>Mona and I made a lecture trip to Boulder and Denver in Oct., returning <del>up</del>down the Platte to Wayne. Thought of you but had to hurry.</p>
                
                <p>We are both still impressed with the fine work you did on the biographical study. Too bad the State committee <span class="unclear ">[flubed?]</span>! But, who knows? The thing may yet appear in complete form, <u>after</u> the Cycle is out in a single volume.</p>
                <span class="closer">
                <span class="salute">Love to all of you!</span>
