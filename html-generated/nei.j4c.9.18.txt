      <p>I'm just leaving for a month's lecture trip, and I want to tell you something before I go. Macmillans have just written me, proposing the publication of my collected poems in one volume next fall. This pleases me, naturally, and I feel sure it will please you. It will be a volume of 700 pages.
</p>    
      <p>I was very glad to hear from you and to know that you have completed your work for the doctorate. Congratulations!
</p>
