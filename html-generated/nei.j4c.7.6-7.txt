<span class="salute">Gentlemen:â€”</span>


      <p>I have just returned from a lecture trip, and find your letter of January 15th regarding the centennial volume to be issued by the University of Virginia.</p>

      <p>I have written no lyrics during the past seven years, as I have been working on my epic cycle of the West of which "The Song of Three Friends" and "The Song of Hugh Glass" are the first two parts. I would be glad, however, to have you use any of my lyrics, all of which are to be found in my volume, "The Quest", published by Macmillans. I would suggest that "The Poet's Town" be used. If you do not have my "Quest", you will find the poem in "The Little Book of Modern American Verse" by Jessie B. Rittenhouse. I feel that "The Poet's Town" would be the most suitable of all my Lyrics.</p>

         <span class="salute">Very truly,</span>
