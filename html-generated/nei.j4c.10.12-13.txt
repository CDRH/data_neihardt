         <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>

         <p>I have made a grievous error in filling Mr. Johnson's order. I had already written my name, in my best manner, at the foot of my contribution, which is the prefatory Note, when I realized that you wanted the signature on the title page. A generous impulse then seized me, and I signed again. Then it struck me, with a sickening sense, that I had given two signatures at the price of one; for since only one was ordered, I could not hope to collect for two. I am out of pocket to the extent of 75 cents and I don't know what to do about it. Were I to purchase a new book, my losses would be still greater.</p>

         <p>It is unfortunate that this worry should be heaped upon me now, for I am engaged in writing a series of lectures for the University of Nebraska - very wise, very profound lectures; and I need all my brain power for the task.</p>

         <p>THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS will appear in April. I hear that the first (de luxe edition) is about sold out. Ten days ago over two-thirds of it was gone. 750 copies at 7.50 per! So there is at least $5,625 worth of love for me in this world. However, I shall never see the $5,625.</p>

         <p>Many thanks for publishing the article about my new book. I appreciate that.</p>
         <span class="closer">
            <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

            <br/>Jno. Neihardt (Doctor John G.)

         <p>I was lately elected a companion of the Order of Indian Wars of the U.S. There are not only living heroes - my own heroes - in that order. There are ghostly heroes, and Custer is one of them.</p>

         <p>SECOND OUTBREAK</p>

         <p>It has occurred to me that you may say something about the de luxe edition of the WARS in the STEPLADDER. For that reason, I want you to know some details. It will be printed on handmade Japanese vellum; cover design, and papers and fifteen full page drawings in colors; initial letters; boxed. Good enough to eat with cream! Macmillan's description recently sent me sounds like a recipe for the wedding cake of a Duchess.</p>

         <p>I don't know that you'll want this; and I am not even hinting that you should run anything on it at all. Just giving you the dope for fear you might want it.</p>
