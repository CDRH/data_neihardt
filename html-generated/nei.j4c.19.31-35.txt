                <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Latham:</span>
                
                <p>Many thanks for your friendly letter. Altho you make no promise, you do say that Macmillans will reconsider the matter of offering the 
                <u>Cycle</u> to the public, and that undoubtedly this will be done during the coming fall. I do hope that those who consider the proposition will actually know the 
                <u>Cycle</u>. Figures on a balance sheet will tell nothing that they need to know in this case. As for the market, we all know that markets are largely a matter of contrivance in these days. When the <u>Cycle</u> is offered, there must be preparation. Among other things, it must not be taken for granted 
                    
                    
                    that reviewers will know anything about the <u>Cycle</u>, and it must be assumed that, even though they know nothing, they <del/>write as though they <del/>were thoroughly well informed. I can and will furnish the necessary article to be sent to all reviewers. One 
                <u>brief</u> reading notice, such as your publicity department sent out, would be ridiculously inadequate. This is only one important point. You as publisher, and I as book-review editor for 25 years, know plenty of others, and we are not naive enough to suppose that merit is enough in such a time as ours.</p>
                
                <p>I note that the one-volume edition of the <u>Friends</u> and <u>Glass</u> has done very well. It is the volume with 
                    
                        
                    which <del/>the Macmillans force has tried to do something.</p>
            
                <p>The <del>strange</del> curious aspect of this whole affair is that I am on Macmillans' side. It <del/> would be foolish to suppose that, as <del/>a business firm, you can afford to <u>print</u> the volumes of the <u>Cycle</u>, and then drop the matter, just when the purpose of years has been achieved. The fact of the war <u>can</u>, &amp; <u>should</u>, be used in our favor. The Trans-Missouri country <u>is</u> a great and important part of our <del>America, and even in New York there are</del> America; and if there ever was <del/>justification for invoking Americanism in support of a <del>book</del>literary work, you have it in this case. 
                
                
                
                We have <del/> a great deal of excellent critical comment on <del>the</del>each of the volumes of the <u>Cycle</u>, even on 
                <u>The Song of Jed Smith</u>, and we should certainly make the most of that fact when the completed <u>Cycle</u> is offered.</p>
                
                <p>Incidentally, I shall be ready with a suitable Introduction when you want it.</p>
                
                <p>Is it a certainty that the Book-of-the-Month Club could not be interested — or some other such <del/>agency? The Book-of-the-Month Bulletin has said fine things of the last two <del/>volumes.</p>
                
                
                
                <p>I do believe you are genuinely friendly to me and that you believe in the 
                <u>Cycle</u>. That's why I feel free to speak out to you. The great Macmillan Company is being <del/> penny-wise and pound-foolish in this matter.<del>and if they <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> attut attitude, the time
                If you
                With kind</del>
      </p>
                <p>I'm about to begin a lyrical thing to be called "I Shall Be Young with You" — something I have kept myself from writing of 25 years. It might well be used as a dedication of the <u>Cycle</u>. </p>
