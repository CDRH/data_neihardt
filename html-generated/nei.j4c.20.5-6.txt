                <p>Many thanks for your letter and the news. I have had no contact with Frank Carr for over 50 years - since he went to California; but I do not forget how we used to recite poetry in unison! I did not know that you knew him.</p>
                
                <p>I'm glad our old friend, the Judge, has gone on. He will, I believe, have a shocking, but happy surprise. His materialism was really a naive obsession. It was what parted us, altho' I had no less affection and gratitude for him. He actually cut me old because of the spiritual meanings in The Song of Jed Smith (and The Messiah earlier)!! It was really comical, &amp; I tried to convince him that I loved him and appreciated him. I wish he could talk to me now!</p>
                
                <p>Things go well here. My Epic America class (the whole 
                    <u>Cycle</u> in a semester with running comment)
                    
                    
                    has become very popular. We have 130 in the class after excluding a great many who could not meet the upper-class requirements (2 semesters of English Lit.). The Head of our department said to me the other day, "John, the whole world is trying to break into that class!"</p>
                
                <p>I'm glad to hear that you are fortified against worldly need, and that, in addition, you are pushing your free-lance advertising. Age is good, Long; really good - except for little (or big) physical failures here &amp; there in one's body.</p>
                
                <p>I do wish I could see you again. Wayne wants me at Alumni home-coming. I may go. If so, I'll see you.</p>
