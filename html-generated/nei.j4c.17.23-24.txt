                <p>Bully to hear from you again! If I have seemed less than friendly, it was only seeming. I've been soused in my work and very happy.</p>
                
                <p>Tell the young lady, please, that she should not complete her thesis before July, when she could have a proof of The Song of the Messiah to study. It will appear in September. Just now I'm doing the few last lines. I'm grateful</p>
