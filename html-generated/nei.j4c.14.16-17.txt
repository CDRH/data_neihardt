      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
      <p>This will be a hurried letter.</p>

      <p>If you think it is worth doing, you may run a short article on the MESSIAH, using any portions of my letter that may seem to mean anything. I could give you some of the opening lines of the poem. How many lines could you use?</p>
                
      <p>We are all sorry that you can't visit us this fall, but we are genuinely glad to hear of Mary's happiness. When you write her next, give her love from the Neihardt family in general.</p>

      <p>Perhaps late in the fall I could manage to get over to Montgomery for a reading as you suggest. I do not plan to be in St. Louis this winter so far as my work for the Post is concerned. Branson is three hundred miles from St. Louis.</p>
                
      <p>I received a copy of SONNETS OF THE NEW WORLD and of course admire them. As for Root, all that I have seen of his gives me a very strong impression that he is of the Blood Royal. If you are in correspondence with him, say that I should be glad to have his volume from him and that it would give me pleasure to do a column about him in the Post-Dispatch.</p>

      <p>Kindest thoughts for Mrs. House.</p>
      <span class="closer">

         <br/>Jno.
