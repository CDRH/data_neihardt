      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
      <p>I'm wondering if the Black Elk book has reached you. It was to have been sent to you more than two weeks ago. I've been doing some lecturing and the crowds all came over in a way that surprises me. Was at Dr. Burris Jenkin's Community Church in Kansas City last Sunday evening. Big crowd. It stayed with me two hours, an hour longer than I wanted, &amp; Jenkins said â€” it would have sat till midnight, though. That is a well-meant exaggeration, I suppose. I wish such things could give me some happiness.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Endless love, good comrade!</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>


      <p>
         <u>Are you well</u>?</p>
