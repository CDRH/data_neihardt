                <p>Many thanks for the letter, the cheese (delicious!), and for everything in general. Bower came to us for lunch at Hilda's on the 26th, and we had a happy time with him. It was <u>so</u> good to be with him. I rec'd the invitation to the Festival and have replied, accepting with a proviso. I don't want to talk about Northwestern literature, as suggested. The period set is from Feb 10 to 24, and I'm sure I could arrange for a weeks absence. I'm willing to go for expenses (which would be considerable) because I want to see you three — and I've been fighting loneliness a bit. I come out here and spend the day quite often, and while here I'm far less lonely.</p>

                <p>Hurrah for Stewart's first verses! As an old poet to a young one, I say: <u>Vale, poeta: Te moriturus saluto</u>!</p>
                
                <p>Two old students came to see me yesterday — one from Georgia, one from Montana. Bless them! I just happened to be at Skyrim when they called. I wonder how many calls I may have missed.</p>
                
                <p>I'm eager to get back to work. I don't like vacations very well. They too thoroughly vacate me!</p>
                
                <p>Did you know about my weakness for <u>fine</u> cheese? It's a <u>very</u> weak weakness. I appreciate the fine, delicate tastes of what you sent.</p>
                
                <p>Alice has been gone with the girls for three weeks. I remarked to Bower <del/> one dies so many little deaths in a long lifetime that he should be an expert when the big death comes! Recently the lines in Jed Smith about "weaning" have taught me as tho' I had not written them myself!</p>
