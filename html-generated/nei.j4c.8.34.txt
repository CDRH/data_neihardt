      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:_</span>

      <p>On the second page of my reply to your Hattie letter, this sentence occurs: "Since then I have written but one lyric which appeared in Century". For this sentence, substitute the following, if you decide to print the thing anywhere: "Since then I have written nothing for magazine publication.<del/> This, I find, is the fact, the lyric mentioned having been written before the time stated. <del/>
      </p>

      <p>I didn't tell you in my unofficial letter of the other day that Hattie and I got into a row very soon after POETRY started. The row began as soon as I saw which way  she was blowing. I think it was that ass, Ezry, who cooled my ardor. After that the braying was deafening, and my love never returned.</p>

         <br/>J.G.N.

      <p>When <u>Poetry</u> was started, the lady gave me every opportunity to become immortal, but the row was fatal.</p>
