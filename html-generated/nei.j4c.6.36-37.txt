      <span class="salute">Dear Mott: —</span>

	     <p>I'm still in a beastly rush, with double work for the Journal, many unavoidable distractions due to the new establishment here, and the necessity I feel for getting on steadily with "The Song of the Indian Wars". Under these circumstances, I have been able to write seventy lines in a week; but my daemon has been with me, and I don't take much of the credit. I don't know just what I mean by the "daemon" business; I merely know that when I need help I seem to get it. Of course I know what modern psychologists would say, and I half believe they are right. But sometimes it seems the whole explanation is not in their books. Anyway, it's glorious to suspect that something stronger than oneself





 is on the job. Also, this suspicion helps one guard against the greatest of all sins — <u>hubris</u>.</p>
	     <p>I think it would be best to have the Iowa engagements for next year — fall or winter. William B. Feakins of New York says he wants to send me out then, and he could handle the Iowa prospects. I'll put him on to you when the time comes.</p>
	     <p>I have seven places (at $50 and local expenses) and have an invitation to make six colleges and universities in the West as far as Spokane. I may cut out the latter, as I feel pushed for time on the cycle. One must be faithful to the gospel of the straight line. It's almost a mania with me. I am alive for one thing, to finish the job I have undertaken while caring for my family.




The caring for the family is not difficult, and will become easier and easier, in spite of the increasing needs. Our Socialistic outlook makes that possible, and then SOMETHING HELPS, or seems to.</p>
	     <p>The laureate business seems to be booming nicely. Several delegations are strong for it, and the Governor will be approached soon. If this goes through, as all boosters feel convinced it will, it will be the first time that any state in the New World has had a laureate by legislative enactment. <u>There</u> is the central idea in the publicity that should follow such action.</p>
	     <p>You will receive a copy of the "Wayfaring" from Macmillans through the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Grinnell​ ">Grinnel</a>
    ​ Review. Would you care to review it, and would they let you do the job? It is really an important contribution to American history; but what means more to me is the fact that it furnishes the background for my cycle. You will note that everything I do or think is aimed in one direction. Also, I am quite shameless in using my wiser friends to the same end. Not shameless, rather unashamed; for I feel the job is worthy, and that I am only the psychic apex of the pattern. You will understand. I can say most sincerely that I want nothing for John Neihardt. He disappears within a short time, and I know he doesn't matter in himself.</p>
