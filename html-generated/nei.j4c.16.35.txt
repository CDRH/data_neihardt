Dr. U. S. Conn
Wayne, Nebraska



<span class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn:</span>
                
      <p>I have yours of June 22.</p>
                
      <p>You may expect me on either July 16 or 17, most probably the latter.</p>
                
      <p>I have just heard that Kearney will have me on the 26th which is just the right date for me, as I can go there on my return from Chadron.</p>
                <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With all kind thoughts for yourself and Mrs. Conn,</span>

         <span class="salute">Sincerely yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
