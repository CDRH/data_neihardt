                <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
                <p>It was very good to hear from you again and to feel the warm glow in you.</p>
                
                <p>There is so much to say, because of the years we have been apart, that there seems to be no place to begin. We should be together a month or more in some lonely place. But I love you.</p>
                
                <p>By now the copy of The Messiah I ordered for you must have arrived.</p>
                
                <p>I like what you had to say in the latest number of the Outpost — <u>particularly</u> one of the book reviews. It's good to hear that Homer is about to publish a volume of verse. I want a copy for review.</p>
               
                <p>In company with a Salt Lake City friend (who is <u>the</u> authority on the history of that country) I plan to cross the Great Salt Desert <u>with horses</u> next summer. No one has crossed with animals for 90 years. It will be a fine experience. Jed Smith crossed the narrower southern portion &amp; nearly died. We can make it nicely with our plan. They say that the <u>silence</u> and emptiness 
                    
                    
                    in the middle of that white desert are something to experience! No native, I'm told, could be hired to go out there on a horse. I'm very eager for the adventure.</p>
                
                <p>I am now through with the Great Plains country — at last. When I crossed the Divide last August, I could say truly — and did — that I was crossing a divide in my life interest. Hereafter my "spiritual center of gravity" is out there, insofar as that center can truthfully be given <u>any</u> geographical location.</p>
                
                <p>Well, here's the old abiding affection, dear good Comrade!</p>
