                <p>Yours of the 2nd has just reached me. It's a trying situation with Pulitzer still in the wilds of New Brunswick &amp; no way knowing when he may emerge. Perhaps the only reasonable thing is for you to go ahead with your preparations for the European trip, letting Fate do the rest. If favorable news should come in time, I should think you could cancel your reservations. I'm quite up in the air, but I'm eager to give you the opening if possible, as you would know without being told.</p>
                
                <p>Fancy how I'm fuming to get at my Black Elk book. Must have it by Nov. 31st. Earlier would be better.</p>
