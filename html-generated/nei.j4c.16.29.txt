      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>For some reason or other my copy of your latest issue has not arrived. Anxious to see it.</p>
                
      <p>I enclose some things that you may return on your next â€” this by way of sending you some of the news. Reviews all over the country have been surprisingly enthusiastic. Movie <u>seems</u> a possibility. Am getting bully stuff in the <u>Messiah</u>.</p>
                
      <p>I wish you would make an effort to find a good medium the very next time you go to N. Y. Wish you were here. My friend, Dr. Schmidt, is living here now &amp; is a very remarkable medium when he is in shape. He would astound you in convincing ways. I feel sure.</p>
                
      <p>This, as you see, is just an interjection, but it carries the same love as always!</p>
      <span class="closer">  
         <br/>Jno.
    </span>
    
      <p>Latham is right. Sure I can get double the amount he mentions if I want it. Will sign contract &amp; push ahead as steadily &amp; rapidly as possible.</p>
    
    
    
    
      <p>Please return the things I enclose</p>
