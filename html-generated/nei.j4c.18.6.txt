                <p>I am sending you a book on Hitler, which seems important.</p>
                
                <p>You will be free to speak out about this, because you will in no way be attacking our system. You may have as much as 450 words. Sorry I can't allow more.</p>
                
                <p>I suppose it would be impossible to have the review here by next Tuesday or Wednesday; if so, let me have it for the next week.</p>
                
                <p>The book should be returned to the Literary Editor, Post-Dispatch, by express collect, not using my name. In this way, I will not have to pay the carriage charges.</p>
                
                <p>When the article is printed, you will receive the check.</p>
