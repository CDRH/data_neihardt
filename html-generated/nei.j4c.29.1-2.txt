                <p>Upon reaching home I wrote Bower at once, addressing him at the University Club. I hope the letter reached him. Also, I wrote to Martha and Beverly, but carefully addressed the letter to 1138 22nd Ave, East, <u>Columbia</u>!! After long search, the postal authorities returned the letter to me. Now that you will soon be at home with Stewart, I'm writing you, as you see.</p>
                
                <p>Need I tell you how

                    miserable I was in your House of Happiness? Poor company, almost nothing to eat or drink, only two beds to sleep in, and neither of those full-size!! Just the same, thanks dear lady, for all your goodness. (I was <em class="hi">not</em> miserable! The <em class="hi">very idea</em>! <u>Who</u> ever <em class="hi">said</em> 
         <u>such a thing</u>?!)</p>
               
                <p>I've been running after horses and sleeping on hay! Feel tired but reasonably happy.</p>
