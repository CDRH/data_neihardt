      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:â€”</span>


      <p>Just received yours of Nov 18., after having mailed you a line about dedication. Hear I'm to <span class="unclear ">[late?]</span>, as I sent proofs from Palo Alto on Nov 16. Curses on my forgetfulness, but I've been driven I tell you.</p>

      <p>You bet I want to see the book you mention. I love the books you get up â€” all peaceful.</p>
