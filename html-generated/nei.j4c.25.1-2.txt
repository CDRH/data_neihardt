                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                <p>What are you doing and saying in the land where you are delaying? Have you a chain to sever? Have you a prison to break? (Do you know O' Shanghnessy?) I don't know where you are — probably in <del/>Texas. When last heard from, you were on top of the Sierras. Since then I've spent 2 1/2 weeks with Alice &amp; the Girls at Lake Cormorant. Then we four drove up here together for a visit. Hild, Alice, and I drove to Chesterfield, Indiana, and had a good time.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Now Alice &amp; the Girls are starting back to Miss. tomorrow (Mon.) morning.</p>
                
                <p>I'm alone, as my grader turned up all married the other day!! He is living in a trailer court. It seems he was married a year ago and his lady withdrew. Now she is back. I had had the impression it was merely a stormy courtship. Seems a nice girl and he is quite a chap. I hope they make it; but it will take some making.</p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>I'm <u>just waiting</u> for y'all to come; and time <u>is</u> passing sure enough. I note with satisfaction that only a little while ago it wasn't <del/> now, and pretty soon it will be tomorrow.</p>
                
                <p>I had a marvelous wheat harvest — $802 from 12 acres. Also, we put up 906 bales of fine clover hay. The barn is full of the stuff — hayloft <del/>
            <u>and</u> stalls. (about 30 tons)</p>

                <p>When I was writing to you yesterday, it was <u>then</u>, then. But now it is not then anymore. It is <u>now</u>, now. Which proves again that time <u>does</u> "fugit", and sooner or later it will suddenly be August!</p>
               
                <p>I've decided to drive back to Miss. with Alice &amp; the Girls. Will stay a week or two then fly back. Address me: Route 1, Box 97, Lake Cormorant, Miss. Love in quantity for distribution. Do take plenty for yourself, dear Lady.</p>
