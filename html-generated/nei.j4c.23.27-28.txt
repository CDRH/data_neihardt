                <p>I have a notion that I'll have a letter from you this morning. This could be wishful thinking. I hope not! Dr. Robinson is changing the date for my talk â€” the 26th, I believe. My ticket is changed for return from Portland the 
                    <u>morning</u> of the 28th. He wants some publicity stuff. Can't you

                    give him enough for his purpose. I have no folder here, but I believe you have one. I've made some suggestions to him.</p>
                
                <p>I'm eager for the day! Bless you and yours!</p>
