                <span class="salute">Dearest Comrade:</span>
                
                <p>I'm on another trip and have been travelling fast. Am a bit weary, of course; but not too much so, as you can see, to write you. How I wish it could be talk &amp; not writing, for I want to feel you close again. I have had some unusual distractions, which account for my neglect of the book. I'm ready to believe its bully &amp; a casual examination yields many fine promises.</p>
                    
                <p>When I get back in November from this trip, I'll plunge in &amp; read the book carefully if I'm not wiped out by 14 engagements &amp; much travel. Of course, I'll not be wiped out.</p>
                    
                <p>Comrade, The Song of the Messiah <u>is</u> beautiful &amp; good. 
                    
                    
                    
                        
                    I have a mind to dedicate it to you! (How about this?) For there is a deep goodness in you that has meant so much to me and shall continue to mean much.</p>
                    
                <p>The American Scholar (Phi Beta Kappa official magazine, <u>very select</u>) has been asking to publish some of the Messiah, saying that Dr. Canby urged it. Why? I don't know. I'm not interested at all.</p>
                    
                <p>Comrade, after the <u>Messiah</u> 
                    only. <u>Jed Smith</u> will remain to be written &amp; then my dream will have been materialized. It will all come true, I know. I do wish you could be happy. But you are a fine spirit, &amp; they feel too much.</p>
