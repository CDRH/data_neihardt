                <p>I received the copy of your letter to Dr. Atherton some time ago. Many thanks! I hope Dr. A. will not feel that I'm over-eager about the whole affair - altho' I really am concerned deeply. I've been on a fairly long voyage, and one of these days, weeks, or years I should see land on the horizon. Mona always spoke rather
                
                
                
                
                wistfully about bronze for the bust, and that's why I care. The cement would last forever indoors if no one ever slammed it with a heavy hammer. Anyway, I know I'll be so far away from all this, that nothing here will matter to <u>me</u> any longer, and I'll not care at all. But we worked together a long, long while to make a good story, Mona &amp; I, and this concern is for the story.</p>

                <u>closer to you than ever before</u>, and I'm so glad for that.</p>
                
                <p>Did I tell you that the U. of Nebraska Press is bringing out <u>Black Elk Speaks</u> in a high quality paper series in the spring? I have to write a new Introduction this month.</p>
                
                <p>I have not heard from Lucile since I left Portland. I hope she is all right.</p>
