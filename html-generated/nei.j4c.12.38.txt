      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>It's a shame I have not answered you sooner. I've been sick with the grip and with two cracked ribs, and have too much work at the office. Shall try to escape before next year if possible.</p>

      <p>For Indian biographies, get <u>Hodge's Handbook of American Indians</u> from the Library. It is in 2 vols, + will give practically all you want on that head.</p>

         <span class="salute">Endless love,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
