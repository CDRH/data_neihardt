                <p>Did you hear that I was awarded the 1936 gold medal by the Poetry Week Council at Rockefeller Center, N. Y., last Saturday night, as "the foremost poet of the nation"? The affair is going on there all this week. The announcement was made by radio Sunday night and in the N. Y. papers Monday (25th). Also, it was on the A. P. wire, &amp; the Post-Dispatch carried it.</p>
