      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:â€”</span>


      <p>"Pierrot, Bookfellow" is bully. Is it intended for a bookplate? I judge so. I wish it had been offered for the Pack.</p>

      <p>Will Mosher publish the illuminated book you mention? If so, I shall have a copy.</p>

      <p>Thank Mrs. Avery for letting me read the poem.</p>

      <p>When you get time, I wish you'd tell me about the banquet.</p>

      <p>Did you see the Literary Digest for May 14? The laureate business has aroused lots of comment.</p>
