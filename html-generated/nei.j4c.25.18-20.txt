                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                <p>I fell into a deep sleep last night, and awoke some hours later remembering that you asked me if I had been at Niagara Falls and my answering yes. I don't know why I gave that answer. I've been in Buffalo several times, but never went to the Falls, altho' I intended to go. I must have been "tired in the head" when I answered. I did feel a bit woozy and "far away".</p>
                
                <p>I feel wonderful this morning, and I'm wondering where you dear people are â€” bless the precious 
                    <u>Three of You</u>! I hope you did reach Boise. I realize more clearly now that you lost much needed time for me. I realize everything more clearly, and what a memory that
                    
                    
                    <div class="note">(over)</div>                   
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    trip has left me! Such memories are real wealth. I even like to think of old man Stuart kicking at night. He can come to my home and kick me whenever he likes. I'd love it.</p>
               
                <p>This was intended to be a short note, so I'll not turn it into the letter I'm <u>thinking</u> in your direction. I'll write to Bower from Phoenix. I feel nearer to him than I ever felt before; and I've often longed to know him better.</p>
