                <p>It's been far too long since I wrote you, but I've thought of you often. Since my last letter, "The Song of Jed Smith" has been finished. It was published on Sept. 21st, &amp; fine things are being said of it and the complete "Cycle of the West". I'll send you some articles later. For some reason not <u>wholly</u> clear to me, there seems to be a notion abroad that <u>Jed</u> is the best of the lot. I'm sending you a copy with my affectionate thoughts to which Mona's are added. I'm only now sending copies to my sisters. You are the first outside the immediate family to receive a copy.</p>
               
                <p>The Principal at Seward has suggested an idea by asking if I could give his students a program. If it is not too late to arrange an engagement at Wayne, and maybe one at the University, I'll do so; and then, perhaps, I could get a string of high schools in Nebraska at a fee much lower than usual. Do you know of many principals or supts. who might be interested?
                    
                    
                    It's strange to feel that old weight lifted from me - a very dear weight, which I miss. But more is in me, and if I'm allowed to go ahead, as I hope, the more will come out. One thing is crowding me even more. I've never been in better health since that constant drain on the solar plexus has stopped!!</p>
                
                <p>Kindest thoughts from both of us to both of you. How are you? I'd love to know.</p>

                <p>I had a Los Angeles manager who contracted me for a lecture on the Pacific Coast this winter. Things looked most promising for several months and then the thing had to be postponed. War scare, it seems.</p>
