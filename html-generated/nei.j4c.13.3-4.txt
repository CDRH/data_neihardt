      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Enid is with me in the office today, and she has been copying occasional pages while I have been going over the MS of the Notes. I am genuinely happy over the work you have done. You are right in saying that the notes are better than those for GLASS and the FRIENDS. I feel that you were all there and that you got under the skin pretty deep. All this should be a real help to students and teachers. As to compensation, if I could pay all my debts in as pleasant a way as you insist I have paid my debt to you, I'd be on the road to wealth. What you say does make me happy, very happy.</p>

      <p>It's good news that Piper will do Frost for you. I think Stuff might do something good about me, as Muns<del/>on, who is close to him, has answered me that he is a very strong fan now, and has even gone so far as to say that it is a disgrace to the University that I am not tied there. I really think Munson quoted Stuff correctly. Would you care to write Stuff in a friendly way, making it clear that you believe he could do some real good by expressing what he may feel about my work? You might suggest that whatever he might write would probably be used in some special way by Macmillans. I think Locke would be good too, <del/> in such an article as you suggest, his interests, not being 


primarily literary. He is a fine sane man, and a real friend.</p>

      <p>Perhaps Sherman would do Cather for you. He could do a fine thing on her.</p>

      <p>It's a delight to know of Mary's success in getting on the inside at Columbia. "Some girl" is right!</p>

      <p>The All-America Movement is getting to be pretty impressive, and if it moves, as I think it will, I may die rich and despised. In addition to this, strange to say, I am gambling a bit on the stock the reasonably poor man who must live dangerously.</p>
