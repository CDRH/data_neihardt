                <p>I have <u>not</u> forgotten you, dear friend! I've been lecturing at the University of Oregon, have been back less than a week, and am still recruiting from the strenuous experience. I was very happy out there — first, <del/> because the climate is marvelous. It's more than half way to heaven in the Willamette Valley, where it's always
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    green &amp; the flowers bloom continually. Then, one of my <u>wife's</u> and <u>my</u> dearest friends is there — bless her heart! It was the <em class="hi">next</em> thing to seeing and being with Mona. They say out there that I'm certainly coming back — next year or maybe before. I'll go whenever they call me.</p>
                
                <p>I flew both ways and took my grandson Robin along. It was a lot of fun.
                    
                    
                    
                    The weather was perfect both ways — golden, quiet; and the crossing of the Continental Divide at 19,000 feet was a great experience. While at Eugene, a Prof. of Western History took my friend and me over to the Umpqua River where Jed Smith's second party was <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="massacred​ &#xA;    ">massared</a>. We played a bit with the Pacific Ocean and had a fine lunch among tall pines.</p>
              
                <p>I talked four times and had two classes.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                
                    
                    <p>Everything goes well. I want to hear from you again. And how is Nita?</p>
                        
                    <p>You are dear to me — bless your heart!</p>

                <p>Tell Nita I often think of her, and I wish we could all have a "night-cap" together. Such things are so good to remember.</p>
