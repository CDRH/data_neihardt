                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                <p>That was a long, long wait, and I was adjusting nobly to a continued silence when your pink note came! <div class="note">Hurrah! Hurrah!</div> I <u>like</u> the pink paper, especially because it is easy on the eyes. The gray paper 
                <u>was</u> a bit difficult.</p>
                
                <p>We've been having snow, snow — more than I've seen before in Missouri at this time of year. Forty two inches this winter, nearly all of it since Feb. 20! Now it is melting slowly but the
                
                
                
                
                wind stays cold. We are threatened with more snow tonight!!</p>
                
                <p>I had two good experiences last week, and I want to tell you about them. I spoke <del/> at the annual dinner of the Law fraternity in the Tiger ballroom last Friday. There was a crowd, larger than usual by far, I was told. The place was full of tables. I was the only speaker and my subject was "Law among the Sioux Indians".</p>

      <div class="note">The Law faculty was there.</div>
                
                
                    
                
                
                <p>I never spoke on this before, and I was doubtful about it; for I've felt that my ability to talk well off-hand had left me. I had even come <u>to wonder if I'd even been any good</u>. I calmed myself with the thought that what I had to tell would be <del>
            <span class="unclear ">new[?]</span>
         </del>new at least, and so I could get by well enough. They put <del>
            <span class="unclear ">me on[?]</span>
         </del> my chair on top
                
                
                
                
                of a table and thus I could see every face. I'm ashamed to say that I talked <u>1 hr. 20 minutes!</u> But the crowd sat <u>absolutely still</u>. They <u>looked utterly absorbed — really</u>. Afterward many said they never saw the crowd sit so still!</p>
                
                <p>Now <u>why</u> did it happen so? I know I made no bumble, that I felt kind and happy and <u>safe</u>. Lucile, the thing would
                
                
                    
                
                
                have sounded well on tape.</p>
                
                <p>The next night I recited lyrics to the Law Wives at Read Hall. It was the same there, with a small group.</p>
                
                <p>I'm reporting this because you are planning to write more about me &amp; my work. (You <em class="hi">are</em> my official biographer yet, aren't you, lovely and learned Lady?)</p>
                
                <p>It's excellent news that in addition to another reading &amp; review of the Cycle, you will give a program of my lyrics!
                
                
                
                
                You know, somehow I <u>must</u> hear you before a crowd. When can that be? I know you are <u>"good"</u>. I'd love to be in some audience without your knowledge.</p>
                
                <p>Here are the books we have handled in <u>Critical Essay</u> class;

      </p>
                
                <p>I've been getting some good work, and it is beginning to be clear to the class that the dominant ideas of these books <u>are closely related</u>; as a matter of fact can be tied together with a unifying principle. It's rather fun!</p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Skyrim is made beautiful inside, but the furniture is still stacked in the back room. We must have a party out there and do some <del/> arranging of things, lovingly. It's a bit sad out there, Lucile.</p>
