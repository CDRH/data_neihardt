                <p>I'm glad for your latest letter, that of last Friday night. I know now that you really did feel deeply about the opening lines of THE MESSIAH. The printing job is beautiful. I would leave the initials, I think. They make a handsome page and that is something.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, spell "ecstasy" the commoner way. There are better etymological reasons for it, which, of course is what you had in mind. You needn't go to any great bother about the italics, though they do have some significance. The caps would spoil the page.</p>
                
                <p>You needn't say anything special in presenting the lines to your readers. If they get it, that will be all right, and if they don't get it, that will be all right too. Such things quite probably matter not at all.</p>
