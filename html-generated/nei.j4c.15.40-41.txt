                <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
            
                <p>Bully to hear again from you, &amp; to note that the bad arm hasn't got you down! Evidently you are doing well, or else you're a helluva cheerful misrepresenter in this case. The letter sounds good.</p>
                
                <p>I've been reading the latest number of P. D. A. L. Excellent again! It's far beyond the doubtful stage, surely, and is a continuing achievement. But tell me which "article poem or book" aroused the ire of somebody &amp; who the somebody was, if anybody?</p>
                
                <p>I wish you were seeing my column daily. Wish you had been seeing it these five years. But that's my fault.</p>
                
                <p>Shall be going about May 5-6-7-8. Need the change damnably. If you could be along!</p>
            <span class="closer">
                <span class="salute">Love always, best of comrades!</span>
                
                <br/>Jno.

                <p>Any amount of kindly thoughts for our friend, Seyster, &amp; thanks to him for the broadcast.</p>
