      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I'm sorry I asked you to do that brief article for the booklet. I find it won't be necessary, as the press stuff can be arranged to tell the story, and I doubt if Macmillans can use all I have prepared for them from reviews. Of course I quote freely from your Sat. Rev. of Lit. article.</p>

      <p>I'll tell Latham, when I send the stuff, that probably you would be able to furnish any additional material he might want.</p>

      <p>Sorry I bothered you, and hope you haven't done my work on the article.</p>

      <p>Things are booming. I'm doing my best for the Journal-Post, six columns per week. First installment appears March 7th. I've done two installments.

And Messiah is growing rapidly and most satisfactorily. The University Extension Center of K.C. wants me for a series of four lectures next season, and Redpath-Harner is on my trail. So things move.</p>

      <p>I forgot to order those new copies of Friends - Glass for you until this minute. I'll do it at once.</p>

         <span class="salute">Endless love, good Comrade!</span>

         <br/>Jno.

      <p>I'm writing for Sat. Review of Lit. too - occasionally only, of course; but they keep asking me again. Very nice connection. Did they pay you for your review of me? You had about $12 coming. It's mostly honor, but they do pay <u>fair</u> rates.</p>
