                <span class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly:</span>
                
                <p>Several weeks ago I received a letter from a Mr. N. W. Harman of Westlake, Ohio, who, for some unknown reason, felt moved to write me about the days more than 50 years ago when he knew me. He said I gave him his love for outdoor life and mentioned things I'd forgotten. (He was only five then, and evidently "looked up" to me). Well, he is the son of Neil K. Harman, a pal of mine 50 years ago. Neil was the fellow who drew and etched on zinc plates the Graff cartoons I used in the Bancroft Blade. I was about to write Neil &amp; get him in touch with you. At
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    the time he was ill, so his son said, and I was waiting until he <del/> should recover. (He lived in Omaha &amp; had become an important executive). Then, when I was <u>beginning</u> to write to Neil, a letter arrived from his son, Noel, telling of Neil's death (thrombosis).</p>
                
                <p>Now why did the son think writing me when you and I were thinking more or less of the Bancroft Blade period of my life? Coincidence? Pattern?</p>
                
                <p>I<del/>'d had <u>no</u> contact with the Harmans for more than 50 years!</p>
                   
                   
                    
                    
                    <p>This is of curious interest, at least; and I'm telling you casually. (1) I don't know anything!!</p>
