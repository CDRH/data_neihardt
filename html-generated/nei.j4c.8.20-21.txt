      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>

      <p>After receiving the page from Goodspeed's catalog of autographs, I set to figuring, and I find, after figuring all night, that my friends owe me nigh onto $750,000. However, I shall postpone suit, as I look for a rising market. In the meanwhile, being a shrewd and far-seeing man, I withhold signatures.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>John G. Neihardt

      <p>Note by a collector in the year 2022:</p>

      <p>This is one of Neihardt's alleged humorous notes so highly prized by collectors. It is said that Mr. Seymour sold it for 35¢, thus sacrificing the friendship of the Doctor, who was a very shrewd and far-seeing man.</p>
