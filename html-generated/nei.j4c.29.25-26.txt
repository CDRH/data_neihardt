                <span class="salute">Dear Slade:</span>
                
                <p>I've just read yours of the 23rd, giving the plane schedule from Columbia to Ithaca. I've been waiting to tell you of a change in plan. 
                    <u>The Westerners</u> of New York City want me to talk at their annual banquet on Wednesday, Oct. 12th at the Seventh Regiment Armory in N. Y. So it seems now that I am to reach N. Y. by jet plane at 3:25 p. m. on Wed. the 12th of Oct. and talk that night.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I'll have several days to knock about N. Y., and I have some friends there â€” two dear ones. Maybe I can get a look at the U. N.! Also, <del>I <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del>I can browse in some bookstores. Then I'll come to you from <u>N. Y. City</u>, arriving on either the 15th or 16th. I'll let you know more later. Thus I'll reach you after an easy trip by plane, <u>and am I eager to see you &amp; Nita</u>! I certainly <em class="hi">am</em>!
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    My sponsor in N. Y. is Sol Lewis, apparently belonging to some publishing firm. He does not know that I was one of the eleven who organized the <u>Westerners</u> in 1945!! Since then the organization has spread all over the U. S. and into England and Germany. Lewis wrote that they would regard it as a "singular honor" to them if I would talk to
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    them!! (He said "address" instead of talk; but I never <em class="hi">address</em> crowds; I just <em class="hi">talk</em> to them. I have a godawful big class in Epic America. When they closed the registration for lack of space, there was a considerable <em class="hi">line</em> of students wanting to register!</p>
                
                <p>You are dear. I'll write more later.</p>
