                <p>It was a pleasant flight all the way, and I was cheated out of my $52,500 insurance — a fact which irks me a bit! But I almost beat the insurance company. We arrived at Columbia Air Port on time; but when we touched the field, it seemed to the pilot that the landing gear was hay-wire. The alarm light started going and the thing said 'beep-beep-beep'. So we circled Columbia for a half hour, hoping to shake the landing gear into shape — then
                   
                   
                    
                    
                    
                    we headed back to St. Louis for a belly-landing, where we'd have proper fire protection. In St. Louis we had a 
                    <u>perfect</u> landing. Then, in another <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="plane​ ">plain</a>
    ​, we flew back to Columbia, two hours late. I was almost a rich man that time !! <u>$52,000</u>!!!</p>
                
                <p>It was such a deep pleasure to be with you two in your home. You are <em class="hi">good</em>. Bless you, and thanks, thanks. I'm now in my house on a lovely quiet day of sun. Had a lunch here for Enid &amp; Hilda. Fine time. There 
                    
                    
                    
                    is <em class="hi">no</em> sadness here. I <u>love</u> the empty rooms. They are truly full.</p>
                
                <p>Do say affectionate, thankful things to anyone <del>who</del> there who cares about me. Such wonderful people!! They make me happy. <u>Elders, Thompson, Wilcox</u>, and all the <u>others</u>. Say very affectionate things to them. <u>And</u> Mrs Olds too!</p> 
                
                <p>I <u>do</u> hope the faculty backs Malott<del>e</del> generously. The situation makes
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    me feel like fighting. It's outrageous! Everyone here <del/> asked me about it.</p>
