      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour.</span>


      <p>I'm returning proofs of the Pack. Please let me see page proof, and I'll mail it back to you <u>immediately</u>.</p>

      <p>There are lines here and there throughout the volume that could be greatly improved by a simple twist of the literary wrist. Two of these I couldn't overlook; the others I have passed up.</p>

      <p>In "Pierrot, Bookfellow", the italicized lines of the second stanza are not clear, owing to inadqeuate punctuation. Have author punctuate according to her meaning. It might be well for her to go over the punctuation of the whole poem.</p>

      <p>On Galley 17, poem "Association", the word "essent" is coined. It won't do. If it really expressed the author's meaning, which I get well enough, I would pass it. But it does not. I have supplied "flowing" tentatively — which doesn't exactly get his meaning, but it's better than "essent", since there's no such word and no excuse for coining it. Perhaps it would be best to have the author supply an epithet of his own.</p>

      <p>I havve cut out seven of Starrett's poems, thus making room for the two of Cheney's and for, let us hope, <del/>some of Sterling's. We have nothing of Scollard, whereas both of the ladies of the committee are represented. (Incidentally, I want to state that I have just now discovered the fact that there are poems in the book by these ladies. I paid no attention to numbers. I read the stuff.) Does Mrs. Seymour write verse? If so, we ought to have one or two of hers. Or have I includ<del/>ed something of hers under a pen name? Try to get one or two from Scollard in a hurry. Tell him I want two of his 





exquisite smaller things. He must have some that he could give. And let's have something from Mrs. Seymour, if she has anything to offer.</p>

      <p>I changed the Note you wrote but slightly. I see no reason why I should splash around in this book. I'm behind the scenes, like the other editors. Let the work speak for itself. It's a pretty good little book, I'm certain.</p>

      <div class="note">Change the number</div>

      <p>You will note that we say there are forty-four contributors. There will be more — I hope three more — Mrs. Seymour, Scollard and Sterling.</p>

      <p>I've written for the three brief speeches made by the dignitaries at the official notification stunt in Lincoln. Will send on all material as soon as possible. The Neihardt Clubs will help to sell the book. How many do you think of printing? A lot of the Neihardt Club members ought to come into the Bookfellows. Also, I'll send a list of people who want the Laureate Address, and may join.</p>

         <span class="salute">Good luck.</span>

      <p>See that new contributions are inserted according to alphabetical order of author's names.</p>

      <p>I had a baby last night, and am doing well, a princess!</p>
