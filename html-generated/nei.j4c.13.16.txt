      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I suggest that you use these three articles under the general heading, "The Contemporary Trend in Literature". The order of articles should be as follows: Misleading Labels, Literature and the Unlettered, The Split Ray. Have the general head large, and the article headings smaller. This is a much better contribution from me than anything I'd do on any special writer.</p>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>
      <p>I thought Stuff's article competent and earnest and quite worth while.</p>

      <p>Can you send me proofs?</p>
