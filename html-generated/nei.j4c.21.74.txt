                <p>I've decided to fly all the way to Ithaca. Will leave here on the 18th or 19th, and will let you know the exact date later. I will not bring sorrow into your home. We will have a spot of that fine old Scotch you mentioned, and the three of us will talk about what we know is good and beautiful.</p>
