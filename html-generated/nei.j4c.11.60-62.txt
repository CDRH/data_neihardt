      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I wrote you late last night. Got to thumbing about you after I went to bed, and got up to write you. It was nearly midnight. I didn't get much said, and I'm looking forward to the visit<del/> when we shall be able to talk again. I want to know all about The Book that you can tell me, and I am deeply interested in what you have said. Few things would give me more joy than that your book should be reasonably successful. I am very eager about it. So many books by mere dubs! Why should not the thought of many years bear print for you and others? I have faith in what you have been doing. If Macmillans take it - bully! But if they don't, then there are other and more driving publishers.</p>

      <p>I am as eager as ever, too, about the new "Man and Poet". Today I received a letter from the National Cyclopedia of American Biography asking for a lot of detailed information for a revision of my biography in that publication. I had considerable space in last year's issue. Things move slowly but surely. The big Chicago radio station wants me to go up their and broadcast something. Boni + Liverright want me to do the chapter on Cooper in their "Writers History of American Lit" - etc etc.</p>

      <p>It's time for "Man + Poet" in 1927, I'd say.</p>

      <p>As yet. I'm too crowded to write on the Messiah, but shall soon 
 
 
 
 have things going on schedule, and then there will be two on three mornings a week. This is largely an <u>editorial</u> job. I write only about 2 cols. Per week; but I have a lot to look after, as I attend to every detail of the page, type selection, makeup (which is some puzzle at times) and everything else. If Pulitzer will let me work out my <span class="unclear ">[plan?]</span>, this will be only distinguished book section west of the Mississippi. The <em class="hi">plan</em> 
         <span class="unclear ">[insures?]</span> 
         <u>this</u>, for I would be using the intelligence of the West. Many are eager to write for me + keep in my scheme. I doubt if young, Pulitzer is very intelligent, I don't mean he is <u>unintelligent</u>. He isn't, of course; and he is a very agreeable gentleman, I'm told; but I think, from what I know, that he has not his Dad's creative fire. He doesn't need it, for that matter, for the P-D is a marvellous organism with tremendous impetus. God! What a newspaper. It has been publishing the largest <u>daily</u> editions in the world lately, and it has distinction. The P-D crowd (1200) seems to adore the sheet. There's a fine spirit throughout the building — wonderful team-play and loyalty.</p>

      <p>Well — more talk; but damn it, it seems to do no good at this distance.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Bless you — whatever that can mean — and love to you.</span>
