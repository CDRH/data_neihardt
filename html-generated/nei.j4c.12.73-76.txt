      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Don't call it "discipline"; the use of the word makes me unhappy. In my two letters on the subject, I said everything that was in my mind. I know well enough that when you are in a position to put your whole mind on the job, you can do better notes for my work than anyone else could do. This is because you genuinely feel <del/> the underlying meaning of the Cycle - the meaning that is not to be explained in words. Without that feeling any comment would be valueless. I know the notes will be fine. As to pay for the article you contributed to the P-D, I knew nothing about it. I hope they <del/> paid you enough. They are really very decent. I do think you ought to have immediate compensation for your 
    <div class="note">(over)</div>
    
    
    
    time and effort spent on the notes. I know well enough that your interest has never been concerned with gain. I'd really be glad to send you a check.</p>

      <p>Walter Locke was here yesterday, asked about you, and wanted your address. So you will hear from him.</p>

      <p>Mona will do the maps within the next two days, and I think I will send Brown a picture of Crazy Horse. Brown says he will have it reprod<del/>uced by their artist to correspond with the other illustrations in the book.</p>

      <p>I do hope Macmillans may do something about our scheme for pushing the cycle. I think they may, and I will keep them stirred up.</p>

      <p>The All-American Movement is developing encouragingly and something may come of it, with the proper management it could be made a very great success. Soon I will send you material that will explain <del/>

    
    
    
    
    the plan to you. If it goes, we will want you in on it. The scheme can be made to have very great social value, and at the same time, if successfully handled, it should be very profitable.</p>
