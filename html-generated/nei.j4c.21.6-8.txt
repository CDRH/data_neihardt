                <span class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly:</span>
                
                <p>It was good, as always, to hear from you again. Here's another report you will want. Last Sunday evening (1-13) I talked to the Presbyterian Students' Center. There were about 80 students present, maybe a few more. We had dinner and then I turned loose in the big lounge. They asked me to talk on Spiritual Conceptions of the Sioux, showing the relationship of same to essential Christianity. Nothing doctrinal, of course, and tending to broaden and illuminate conventional conceptions based upon an alleged historical event.
                   
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Certainly it was not orthodox, but it <u>was religion</u> — and you should have seen how they sat without a motion and <u>listened</u>. I talked more than an hour, and they wanted more. Afterward Rev. Cahill (in charge of the activities at the Center) told Mona that in the four years he has been there in charge he never saw such a response from the students. A student of mine, who was there, told me that after I left, the students did not lark about, as usual, but sat about in circles talking earnestly about
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    the affair. This <del/>seems boastful, and perhaps I should have had Mona tell you, but I'm only reporting for your dissertation, if you can use the report.</p>
                
                <p>The little affair is typical in the matter of method (quite unplanned). The original approach is wholly informal, almost casual, or quite so. But something vital to the purpose is being said all the while. And then the <u>change</u> comes — that "click". After that they are <u>mine</u> and I am theirs, and what is said <em class="hi">feels</em> 
                   
                    
                    <u>good</u>
                    
                    
                    
                    as it is said — and feels unquestionably <em class="hi">true</em> also. There is really no technique — just a loss of self in <u>them</u> and the <u>ideas</u>, along with a glow like affection. They seem <em class="hi">dear</em>. Do forgive this seeming vanity. It's only seeming, really.</p>
