                <p>Here is the latest about Sigurd. He went thru the kidney operation in fine shape, and altho' a bit weak, he is up and around. But we've just learned that all the tissue surrounding the left kidney (now removed) is cancerous. They will use the new <del/> machine at the Medical Center here to treat him.

                <p>Dr. Chapman (Western History) told this to Ollie the other day;
