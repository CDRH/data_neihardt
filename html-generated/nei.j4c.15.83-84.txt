                <p>I've just wired you.</p>
                
                <p>The news hit us hard, and our feeling for you and Mary is warm and deep. I am not going to juggle hollow words, but I <u>do love you</u>, best and dearest of comrades; and I <u>care</u>. You are not going to be downed by this, I know, for you have great reserves of philosophical insight and good sense to draw upon. It is good that you two had a happy trip together last fall and that Mrs. House went while still feeling the glow of Morrie's triumph and with the happy consciousness of Mary's goodness and beauty.</p>
                
                <p>I'm wondering when we are going to be together again. We must plan to this end.</p>
