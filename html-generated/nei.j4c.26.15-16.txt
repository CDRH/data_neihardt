                <span class="salute">Dear Slade:</span>
            
                <p>You know I think of you very often, whether I write or not. You are dear to me.</p>
                
                <p>I'm so glad H. B. has bought a modern home in town. It did not seem right for him to be out there alone, and I <u>know</u> he did 
                    <u>not</u> like it. Silence and solitude are necessary now and then, even at frequent intervals; but we <u>are</u> gregarious beings.</p>
                
                <p>Many thanks for delivering my message to Thompson and to Wilcox. Bless their wise and good hearts!</p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>My classes this semester are bully, as usual. I always fear, each semester, that my <u>Epic America</u> class will fall off, at last. It never does, somehow, and I'm always surprised at the perfect attention they give me. They are sweethearts!</p>
                
                <p>In my Writing of Poetry class I have some really gifted students. I teach, of course, <u>by indirection</u>. The purpose is to create a <u>group mood</u>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    in the class which will make it a pleasure to work on verse as a means of expressing poetic experience. Before the end of the semester my classes, thus far, have all become unified with a feeling of something like affection for each other. You know, I believe, that <u>I</u> have come to <u>think of poetry</u> as <u>a way</u>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    of seeing the world of men &amp; things â€” a <u>way of being</u>, rather than of <u>way of writing</u>.</p>
                
                <p>Anyway, I love you. Be happy. And give my warm regards to your precious Nita.</p>
