                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                <p>It's a long, long while between times but I have something good to tell you, and so I'll not want to tell it.</p>
                
                <p>Yesterday I had my last class in Epic America. It was a 2-hour period and I filled it with  <u>The Song of the Messiah</u>. When I finished, the <u>whole audience exploded in applause simultaneously</u>, and they kept it up until I stopped them. I could see
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    the whole audience (176) and every person was applauding. Afterward many came up and said appreciative things One man said: "It has been an honor, sir, to be in your class." Many said similar things.</p>
                
                <p>I'm always surprised at such responses; 
                    <u>very much so</u>. Those youngsters had sat through a whole semester of the
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <u>Cycle</u>, and I felt they were entitled to feel at least mildly bored during the final period, for which no credit was given.</p> 
                
                <p>Lucile, I do hope you are all well and that <del>that</del> nothing is wrong. Surely I know of nothing wrong, and you are all dear to me as ever.</p>
                
                <p>It's a joy to have Alice and the precious girls at Skyrim
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    The place is <del/> very much alive now; and beautiful horses go ramping around the ring as before Nanny left us. I <u>wish</u> you &amp; Bower and old Stewart could see our horses now! It's a lovely bunch, surely. Bourbon Stonewall, the American Saddle Horse stallion, is too beautiful for words. And the mares and fillies!!!</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>I've wondered if my remark about <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="your​ &#xA;    ">you</a> English chairman could have been misunderstood. I meant nothing disparaging about him (I don't know him), merely meant that if he, as so many others, is sold on the modernistic so-called poetry, he <u>could not</u> care for the Cycle. But he may well be <del/> immune to the disease.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>You know Tom Harris — <u>assistant</u> to the Dean? Well, he has been appointed 
                    <em class="hi">Assistant Dean</em>, and it's a good thing. He really knows his stuff and is very efficient. Seven or eight years ago he was a student of mine. It makes me happy when someone, anyone, wins through merit.</p>
                    
                    <p>The other day when I congratulated Harris,
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    he told me he had been reading a mystery novel recently, and one of the characters asked another what he was reading. The answer was "<u>Neihardt's Cycle of the West</u>!" There was a paragraph of comment. <del/> Harris forgot the title of the book, but he'll tell me. I'd like to see the reference.</p>
                
                <p>How <u>are</u> you? Are you fairly free from the allergy
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    trouble? I do hope so. Tell Old Man Stewart that Robin lost his doggie; but he has earned $15 from his Gaki, and soon he'll be <del/> buying another hairy bundle of affection and goodness.</p>
                
                <p>And, Perky! Sweet thing! Pet her for me. And here is some more of the old affection. Please pass it around, and help all you care for.</p>
