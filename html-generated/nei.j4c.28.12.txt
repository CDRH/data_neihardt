                <p>Bully to hear from you again! Surely I wrote you about being with you Oct. 19, didn't I? It's a good time, and I can arrive at the beginning of the week, Oct 16.</p>
                
                <p>We had a mild winter here until Feb. 20. Then the snow began and we had more than I ever saw here before. It's gone now, and there's a lot of green grass for the precious horses.</p>
                
                <p>This is Monday p. m., and Hilda, the kids &amp; are going out to Skyrim to put up pictures, arrange rugs.</p>
                
                <p>I'll write again soon.</p>

                <p>Yes, I <u>do</u> have the copies of <em class="hi">Coster</em>. Will send some. They are at Skyrim</p>
