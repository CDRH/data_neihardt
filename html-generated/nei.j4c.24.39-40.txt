                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
              
                <p>I was so glad to see your handwriting on an envelope yesterday! And it is a dear letter as always.</p>
                
                <p>We've been having a happy time together. The establishment here is excellent, and there is a great deal of fine horse-flesh on the place. <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Alice has until July <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> to wear her cast. Twelve weeks thus far! She has been brave, surely.</p>
                
                <p>The children are so <u>sweet</u>. Bless them!</p>
                
                <p>We spent three days last week at the <u>big, swank</u> horse-show at Germantown, Tenn.
                  
                  
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Lynn won 4th with a horse trained only since last Sept. against a field of high-powered horses with 3 yrs. training. There were only six horses, but they were all tops. She also rode in the juvenile pleasure class on the golden stallion. She &amp; the horses made a dream picture — both so blond, as though they were made of the same stuff.</p>
                
                <p>I must return to Skyrim this Saturday, June 20th; so you should write me there.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                <p>I have a lot to say, but this is an awkward time for letter writing.</p>
                
                <p>Mary Weymouth is at Lincoln now, and will come down on Sunday to see me. That's why I'm hurrying back, I'd prefer to stay here awhile.</p>
                
                <p>I have become very well acquainted with the <u>spotted pony</u>! He is a darling, and far too knowing for a horse.</p>
                
                <p>Someday it will be August first!! You are very dear.</p>

                <p>Lynn &amp; Alice have just said, "<span class="unclear ">Give[?]</span> her dear thoughts — very, very dear thoughts" That 
                    <u>is</u> what they said. And Alice sends affectionate greetings.</p>
