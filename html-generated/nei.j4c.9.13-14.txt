      <span class="salute">Dear Mott:-</span>


      <p>I think you will be glad to hear that THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS is finshed at last. Allen True, the mural painter is working on the drawings for a <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="deluxe​ ">
            <u>de luxe</u>
         </a>
    ​ edition which Macmillans will bring out in January shortly before the trade edition is published. True knows Indians and the West, and there is every reason to believe that he will make a very beautiful book. There will be a cover design, end sheets, title page, initial letters and fourteen full page drawings - not illustrations of particular incidents, but illustrations of the mood of the WARS. True has been working with Brangwyn in England on some big mural stuff, but is now resting in Italy. He calls working on my book recreation.
</p>
      <p>I feel pretty sure that you will regard the WARS as my best thing in every way.
</p>
      <p>I passed through New York last November, but was in a hurry and could not take the time to look you up; but I thought about you and wished I could see you.
</p>
      <p>Everything is going finely for the big Scheme. As you may know, Macmillans have issued both the FRIENDS and GLASS in one volume of the Modern Readers' Series. The book contains 335 pages and is unusually well gotten up in every way, yet the wholesale price is 66 cents! The reports are very encouraging. The book appeared in May, and at the Chicago meeting of Macmillan men this summer, it was reported that the volume is "selling heavily in spots all over the country, <u>especially in New England</u>".
</p>
      <p>Recently I sold a six months option on the world motion picture rights of the FRIENDS. My agents believe the option will be exercised. The intention is to make a "super film" of it.
</p>



      <p>There is a lot to tell, but I don't weary you.
</p>
      <p>I want to hear from you again. What of your work at Columbia? I judge you are or have been, working for a doctorate. Tell me when I may begin to use the title.
</p>
      <p>When I was in New York last November Macmillans urged me to make a contract for the WARS. I did so, at a far better figure than was ever offered me before. Macmillans hadn't seen a line of the poem! This is an encouraging symptom, isn't it?
</p>
      <p>But there! Talking about my stuff again!
</p>
      <p>With every kind thought,
</p>
