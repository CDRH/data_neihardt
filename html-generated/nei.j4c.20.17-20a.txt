                <p>That was a precious letter — bless your warm heart!</p>
                
                <p>It is good to hear about your children — all of them fine young people, and going places, "high-hearted with a hunger for the new". I feel deeply all you 
                    <u>say</u> of them, and <u>what can</u> 
         <em class="hi">not</em> 
         <u>be said</u> even more. How very worthwhile it all is!</p>
               
                <p>Things go well here, as usual. Nice, spangly Xmas with five (5) grandchildren to furnish the enthusiasm and sense of wonder. We do not think of

                    the celebrations as applying only to the Christ story (a symbol of tremendous meaning in itself). Surely it has a wholly non-sectarian <u>cosmic</u> significance that was profoundly felt long before the Christian era.</p>
                
                <p>Alice's horse business is growing rapidly. She has a riding school, as you may know. It is well patronized, but the horse raising and training is more important in the long run. She has 12 horses of her own and is boarding and training several others — with the help of Mr. "Dick" Cook of Stephens College. He is

(He is nearly 60 years old &amp; all his life has been spent with saddle horses). Alice has several really fine horses, and Mona &amp; I have one. Really top horses, some of them, with the very best bloodlines. Also, Mona &amp; I have four ponies — two of them mares with foal. We expect some beautiful colts in the spring.</p>
