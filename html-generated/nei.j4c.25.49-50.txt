                <span class="salute">Dear Bower:</span>
                
                <p>Many thanks for the "amen" attached to Lucile's recent letter! That is the nearest thing to a letter I've received from you since that happy time we four had together on that wonderful trip. <u>Wasn't</u> it a happy time?!</p>
                
                <p>One of these days I bet you'll write me a whole letter, and I'll be glad.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, our friend, Moffet, has been growing right along.
                
                
                
                
                I watched him doing it, and at very close range â€” about five feet, to be exact!</p>
                
                <p>At present he is off on a wide-ranging trip to the battle-fields of the South. He knows a lot about them already, but he'll know plenty when he gets back! I spent some time on the field of Shiloh, and was so fascinated that I read most of two weeks about the battle after I came home.</p>
                
                <p>By now you are going full-steam ahead out there.
                
                
                
                
                
                We began here on Sep. 17, a Thursday. I had feared that my Epic America class might be smaller than usual, but they poured in. Bless them! My Writing of Poetry class is a bit larger than I like, but I can handle it.</p>
                
                <p>We have had the driest summer and fall that I can remember.</p>
                
                <p>Bower, as I have told Lucile, I don't like you too; and
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I hope you don't like me the way I don't like you.</p>
