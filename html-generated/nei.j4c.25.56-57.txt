                <span class="salute">Dear Stewart:</span>
                
                <p>Your dear Daddy wrote me a real letter, and in that letter he told me, among other things, that you have two beds and that you will give me my choice of the two when I come, <u>or</u> let me have <u>both</u> if I want them. Many
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    thanks, old pal! One will be enough, I believe; but I do appreciate your <u>characteristic generosity</u>. (I'll bet you can't read <u>that</u> one all by yourself. But I'll bet you Mama or Popa can explain.)</p>
                
                <p>I am enclosing pictures taken from the current issue of <u>Pony Magazine</u>.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I'm very fond of my Hackney filly, <u>Creation's Queenie</u>, and I love her very much. She is an aristocratic horse girl, and <u>very beautiful</u>. Her Popa and Mama and all her relatives are snooty blue-bloods, and just don't speak to common horses who are not registered!!
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I am eager to have Queenie go to horse college and learn how to trot like a champion. She will start school in October. Next year, she will go to the big shows; and the year after I am going to drive her in the <u>big</u> 
                    Florida shows!</p>
                
                <p>How are you? How is school? Mine is <del/> fine.</p>
