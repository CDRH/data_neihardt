      <span class="dateline">April 9, 1906</span>
George Edward Woodberry, Esq.,
<span class="dateline">London, England.</span>
      <span class="salute">Dear Sir:—</span>


	     <p>I have been making considerable study of your
collected poems of late, and the more I have read the greater
has been my desire to write a letter of appreciation to you.
It has always seemed to me that a word of appreciation even
from the least to the greatest could hardly be considered
out of place, especially by a man whose soul is great enough
to make a poet of him. Also, there is among all true lovers
of Beauty a tie that binds. And in my way I am one of these.</p>
	     <p>Although I had read your work in periodicals from time to
time, I had never quite discovered you until my friend,
Mr. Ledoux of New York, put me in the way of seeing you in
your true  bigness. Since then I have placed your poems in
that portion of my library sacred to Shelley and Keats.
I place you between these, for I think I have discovered your
spiritual kinship to both of them, although I feel that you 
are nearer the former.</p>
	     <p>In my correspondence with Mr. Ledoux there have been
for me many interesting developments; but when he spoke 
of you as a man with whom he was acquainted, I experienced
a feeling of awe when I touched his letter, and I found myself





quoting:</p>

	     <span class="lg">
         <span class="l">Ah, did you once see Shelley plain,</span>
	        <span class="l">And did he stop and speak to you</span>
	        <span class="l">And did you speak to him again?</span>
	        <span class="l">How strange it seems and new!</span>
      </span>
	
	     <p>I am one of those who prostrate themselves before genius —
and that alone. If you no longer do this yourself, I feel
safe in saying that there was a time when you could do this
and be utterly sincere.</p>
	     <p>I beg you to believe that I have not written this letter
with the vulgar desire of obtaining your autograph. I have
merely wished to let you know that on the prairies of the
West there is another who admires you.</p>
	     <p>I judge from Mr. Ledoux's correspondence that this will
find you in Sicily. I hope that it will find you with that
unfailing belief in self which is the strength of the artist.
The world needs great poets now and always; and you have a
great mission. I know that your poetical work is not yet
read by the many — perhaps it never shall be. And to me
this is not the smallest portion of the praise which you
receive. I think Shelley could have spoken a wise word
on this subject. The world at large does not ask for its
great artists. They come of their own accord and establish
themselves in the hearts of men only under protest. They are
the guests who ultimately can not be denied.</p>






	     <p>It does my soul good to feel that we have a poet of
large dimensions among us. To a lover of Beauty there is
much of discouragement in the present day commercialism.
The majority of our countrymen are hopelessly sordid in their
ambitions. They know nothing of that Upper Air which all 
of us may  breathe if we wish.</p>
	     <p>O the poor foolish ones who think that wealth means
money! Long after these silly heaps of stocks and bonds
have ceased to exist except in fables with bitter morals,
you and the few others among us who sing of the higher life,
will be living, breathing realities.</p>
	     <p>You know all this; but I wanted you to know that a new
friend, living far away from you, has applied these truths
to your life and work.</p>
	     <p>If you had written nothing but "He ate the Laurel and is Mad"
and that exquisite first lyric in "Siena", you should have
been deeply impressed upon my heart. But when you wrote "My
Country", all good Americans became your debtors, although
they may not be conscious of the fact.</p>
	     <p>I want to see you the Shelley of the western world.</p>
      <span class="closer">
			      <span class="salute">Most sincerely yours,</span>

			      <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
