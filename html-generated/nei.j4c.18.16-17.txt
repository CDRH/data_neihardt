                <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
                <p>It was bully to receive yours of December 25th.</p>
                
                <p>Of course I'll write Lewis, as you wish, and it will not be difficult, as I feel that his idea is undoubtedly good and that he will be able to handle it in an effective way.</p>
                
                <p>The news about Morrie Ryskind delights me. I am so glad for Mary, and I hope that some of the people in Wayne, who really meant no harm but were only petty, know all about her and her husband. Not long ago, Mona and I saw MY MAN GODFREY and we got a real kick out of it. I noted with pleasure that Ryskind had a hand in the making of that picture. It's hard for me to understand how in hell any man can make that much money, but since we are living in a sort of dog-fight civilization, I throw my hat in the air for any man who can make plenty of what it takes.</p>
                
                <p>I suppose you would be unhappy if you were in California with nothing to do but live and twiddle your thumbs, although I should think that you could be digging things out of yourself in between thumb-twiddlings. Surely you have more than one book in your system. I do hope that you will get the book you now have in hand as you want it, and see no reason why you should not. There ought to be a place for it.</p>
                
                <p>You ask who would be likely to take my place here if I should leave to do my work. That question gave me an idea which might be worth considering, and I think you know what the idea is. I cannot yet have any definite plans as to when I can begin on THE SONG OF JED SMITH, but I know that I shall begin before too long. At present, I have in mind the possibility of putting over a number of things with the movies. One of the big firms is considering THE DAWN BUILDER, which I believe has the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="elements​ ">elemtns</a>
    ​ of a corking movie in it. If I could get by with this or with any one of a half-dozen of my short stories, I could probably <del/>push the Cycle, and there is certainly good stuff in that--especially in THE SONG OF THE MESSIAH, as I have it schemed for a movie. It seems possible that I may get hold and if I do, you could imagine how long I'd be in this smok<del/>y city. I'm not unhappy here and certainly it's a lovely job in every way. But there are better things to do.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I have a chance to go to Buffalo University and to a women's college in New York State sometime in the late winter. Perhaps it will be possible to hook these up with an engagement in Charleston, but if I did not go any other place, I'd like to lecture in Charleston, so that you and I might have an old-time powwow.</p>
                
                <p>I am about to give the final reading to that page, and it will have to be goodbye for now. You may be sure of my enduring love.</p>
