Sunday night</span>



      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
      <p>I've been thinking of you a good share of the time and wishing there were something I could do to help you; but, as usual, when the big needs come one is hard to reach with help.</p>
                
      <p>I'm wondering what you are planning, or may plan. I wish I could be with you. If you are to be in Montgomery, as I suppose you will be, I'd like to visit with you, if possible.</p>
                
      <p>When I hear from you again and know that you have begun to go ahead again, I will send you several letters I want you to see.</p>
                
      <p>I was about to write you that you sent the wrong book, which I returned, when your note arrived from N. Y.</p>
                
      <p>I <u>want</u> to get at you, but a letter is no good.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With the old love, dearest of comrades!</span>

         <br/>Jno.
