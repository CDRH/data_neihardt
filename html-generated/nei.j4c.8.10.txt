      <span class="salute">Dear Mott:</span>
    
      <p>Thank you for the clippings. I had seen only the stuff in the Des Moines papers. Also, I want to thank you for your introduction that night. I was very sorry that you couldn't stay. I wanted a real talk with you very much.</p>

      <p>I was greatly dissatisfied with my voice at Des Moines, for I struggled with a frog in my throat all evening. Then, too, the room was very poor for speaking, &amp; the crowd close about me dulled sound. So I was surprised to hear from several sources that the impression was good.</p>

      <p>At Indianola it was very different. My voice was quite clear, and the auditorium there is good. 
    
    
    
    I felt half gagged in the Younkers Tea Room, free and easy in the Simpson auditorium. It isn't in the least a matter of nervousness, for I've never felt nervous before a crowd. Even if the audience should seem against me, I'm sure I couldn't feel nervous. I'd feel defiant then, audacious. Luckily, I've never had an audience that showed the least discourtesy. They've always been good to me.</p>

      <p>Since you were responsible for my appearance at both these places, I'm glad indeed to know that I seem not to have betrayed you.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Always yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. N.
