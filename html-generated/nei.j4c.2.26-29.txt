      <span class="salute">Dear Old Man:—</span>


      <p>How are you and what are you doing? When I last heard from you, the outlook wasn't merry; but I'm happy by this time you have got the <span class="unclear ">[grip?]</span> again.</p>

      <p>What of the world—Tramp you mentioned as a probability? It would be fine in a way, but don't you need a scholar's seclusion &amp; quiet for <u>your</u> real work? Don't you think constant change of scene &amp; The state of mind that wandering gives would tend Toward scatteration? No vagabond could have done your splendid sonnets.</p>

      <p>Sterling, I think a great deal about you, you seem like a relative who has always been far enough





away to remain a bit mysterious.</p>

      <p>I often think of your Trouble &amp; feel hurt. It's a shame that you couldn't just go on greatly doing what you are so wonderfully fitted to do. I know all about the Gospel of Suffering. Much of it is <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>; some of it is true. It seems to me, though, that pain is good for discipline only in the early <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> stage. Later a man needs peace &amp; a steady purpose. I should like to think of you growing old in Carmel. People <span class="unclear ">[mouth?]</span> about the world as though it were something distant that one must reach by a journeyand it is right here at any door among the cornfield. I have found as much superficiality among the learned in <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>




as among the bumptrous members of our rural woman's clubs. I have no desire to knock about. Did you ever see anything new or strange? Did you? It's such an old story when a fellow gets there.</p>

      <p>Do you ever read Greek or Latin? All winter I've slept 3 hours a night on Greek, &amp; I look forward to that time as to a vacation. All day I read &amp; discuss modern things &amp; at night there's that wonderland waiting.</p>

      <p>I spend Fridays, Saturdays &amp; Sundays on my "Song of Hugh Glass", &amp; the thing forges ahead in a way that surprises me. Have been getting 50 lines per week on the average.

There is no padding in it. Old man, I believe I'm getting something worth while. Hope to finish by May.</p>

      <p>Wish I could see you &amp; have a hell of a good pow-wow with you!</p>

      <p>Have had two fine letters from E.A. Robinson lately.</p>

      <p>How about picking out poems?</p>

      <p>Did I send copy of "<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> of Satan?"</p>
