                <span class="salute">Dear Slade <u>and</u> Nita:</span>
                
                <p>Well, as you see, I'm here! Everything is fine, and I'm richer for the memories I have of my days with you there. <u>You are very dear</u>.</p>
                
                <p>We reached St. Louis a bit late, and the waiting for the Ozark plane was <u>not</u> trying. Alice, Lyn, and Erica were waiting for me at the airport. We were about 40 minutes late.</p> 
                
                <p>I'm judge in the poetry contest <del/> of The Poetry Society of Texas again
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    this year (the narrative section only), and I've just chosen the first ten best ones as I see them. Four of these are really good, the other six not at all bad. I've judged for the Texas Society a number of times. Once I gave first to a little masterpiece of a ballad <del>on</del> about an old buckaroo. (It got into Readers' Digest). The deadline this time was Oct. 20, and I reached home on the 21st! So I hurried with the reading.</p> 
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>How I do love to think of that beautiful country, and you in it! No fine colors here, except an occasional but rare hard maple. They had a frost &amp; a hard freeze while I was with you. It came <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="afterâ€‹ &#xA;    ">afer</a> that hard rain (an all-night, slow rain of about 2 inches.) My wheat is coming up, and I'll be rich and despised when I harvest my crop next June!</p> 
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>I <u>do</u> hope I left <u>some</u> pleasant memory among those who were in my classes or in the Olin audience. (I know it was so in N. Y. City)</p> 
               
                <p>Yo-Yo was very happy to see me!! They told her I was coming, and she jumped up &amp; down, barking and whining. I wonder if she 
                    <u>did</u> understand.</p> 
                
                <p>We have cool but golden weather, and I fancy it's the same with you.</p>
                
                <p>Oh, those enchanted nights!</p>
