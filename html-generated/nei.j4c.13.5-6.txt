      <span class="dateline">Sunday</span>

      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Hurrah for the first member of the new Review! I'm all for it + eager to see it. Of course, it will take time to make it what you want it to be.</p>

      <p>When would you want the stuff on Robinson, and how much?</p>

      <p>Macmillans made <u>no</u> comment on the bulk of the Notes, and will go ahead immediately with the edition. They gave me a liberal contract on the school edition, + it seems they may do something special to push the books in schools. I am ready

to sacrifice all royalty for a year or two. If they will do something real in the way of pushing. I have not made such a proposition, but will at the proper time.</p>

      <p>Signs of any success in St. Louis multiply surprisingly, and I've been hearing gratifying gossip from among the P-D force. If I were to stay here, I'd be something of an institution, I suppose. Even now, I sometimes seem to be something of the <u>sort.</u>
      </p>

      <p>Yesterday I was moved into a large luxurious office on the top floor - the 8th - with a wide 


view over the city through windows that fill the whole outside of the room. The hall outside is all polished marble + I have a chandelier!! Great place to receive ladies, who visit one in considerable numbers!</p>

      <p>The "movement" thrives. The American Express Co. has made us a flabbergasting offer to handle it for us at a good margin of profit to us, + my partner will probably office in N.Y. with the Express Co there.</p>

      <p>When are you coming over to see me - us? You + Mrs. House both. Make it in warm weather + we'll drive all over this beautiful country + sit around + dream dreams.</p>

         <span class="salute">Endless love, dearest Comrade!</span>

         <br/>Jno.
