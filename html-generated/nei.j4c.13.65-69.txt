      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Just a note in haste to assure you that things go finely with me. The market did not smash me. I had sold most things and what I hold I own outright. Naturally, if I sold what I have at present prices I'd be behind on that particular deal, but I'm holding and shall continue, since I don't need the cash. The only thing that makes me sad, sometimes almost desperately so, is the growing conviction that our civilization is, without the least exaggeration, an unmitigated fool. But I don't want to write about that here.</p>
                
      <p>I did my stunt for the National Council of Teachers of English in K. C. on Saturday, and had a fine reception.</p>
                
      <p>My column here is winning in a way that surprises me more than most things in my life have. Within the past three months the responses have been gro<del/>wing in number and coming from many places. Also, the attitude toward me here in the Post and the general attitude in St. Louis <del/>are rather astonishing to me. The column, to put it briefly, is getting to be something of an institution. I wonder and wonder why this very decided response should
    <div class="note">(over)</div>
    
    
    
    break loose after three years - almost - of stu<del>u</del>ff just as good as I'm doing now. It has been said that my column is alone in the country. I can't see why the Post lets me go ahead as I do, for I say <u>plenty</u> pretty often. And I am <u>not</u> wrong when I am moved to speak out as I do.</p>
    
      <p>It's queer how you feel about the MESSIAH. I think you are clairvoyant, whatever the explanation of that unque<del/>stio<del/>nable phenomenon <del>may be</del> of clairvoyance may be. Recently a medium here told me she saw a book <del/> - "one you have begun to write but have not completed" - "and suddenly it turns to almost pure gold in my hands and from it arises a purple etherialethereal that reaches the heavens." I myself do not believe this so far as I know, and I doubt if I am eager to write anything, except as I may be compelled. I don't seem to care much what the world thinks of me, save as what it says may mean that I am helping here and there. You write of the "MESSIAH" MUCH AS various mediums have spoken. (I'm not thinking of "spiritualism" in this connection. I suspect there's a better explanation that would fit the Hugh Glass country business too.) The medium mentioned added: "Man, I give my shoes, I'd sacrifice anything to write that book"! But damned if <u>I</u> can see any reason for such eagerness. Not now, anyway, though I have a haunting feeling that I'll surely write it. Of course, the <del>message</del> meaning of the poem, as I now conceive it, is to me the key meaning of all our suffering. I feel that meaning with an intensity that sometimes nearly lifts me off my feet. I've felt it alone out in our back yardbackyard 
    <div class="note">(over)</div>
    
    
    
    
    and felt it so deeply that I'd catch myself crying; and I'd feel ashamed. God knows I'm colder inside than I was when you knew me by constant contacts, and I never was given to tears. I hope I don't sound mushy. I tell you, I feel cold as ice most of the time. And I seem to want less and less of anything. Maybe I <u>am</u> being gotten ready to do something worth doing. I hope so.</p>
    
      <p>As for getting to Branson, we're going, if for no other reason than to get away from the immediate vicinity of so much social insanity. Down there I could forget much. It has been suggested here, voluntarily, for I've said nothing that Bovard, the Czar of the Post, would undoubtedly let me do almost anything I might want to do. I'm not so sure, but I intend to try to make arrangements for my present salary in Branson. I could save two and a half hours a day by not having to travel, and I could use that for the Messiah. Anyway, we are going to Branson. Have fixed up our home there and made it beautiful and comfortable.</p>
    
      <p>Yes, go to see Jones. Don't miss the opportunity. He is a Catholic mystic, but his mysticism is genuine beyond any possibility of doubt. Have him tell you of his experiences.</p>
                <div class="note">(over)</div>
                
                
                <p>He tells only close friends, and will have nothing of the sort printed. But he will tell you if <del/> he knows I want him to do so. I'll send you an article, two or three paragraphs of which will make clear the man's special quality and power.</p>
      <div class="note">This is at home, will send it tonight.</div>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Endless love,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>
      <p>I do know that if necessary &amp; possible, you would literally mortgage your life, as you say, to have the <u>Messiah</u> finished. I'll finish it, be sure.</p>

      <p>Good things to tell you - but how to begin?</p>
