      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>

      <p>I have the proofs of the Pack. Will get them back to you within a week.</p>

      <p>George Sterling ought to be represented. It happens that he has just sent me a sheaf of unpublished poems — a way he has of doing with me. They are all Sterlingesque, and therefore exquisite. Do you mind if I arrange to include one or two of his poems? I think I can manage it.</p>

      <p>Yes, some of Starret might be left out. His work was so far above the mass of material sent me that I couldn't reject any of it. I was thinking only of merit. Several rather piffling things were included in order to increase the number of authors.</p>

      <p>I'll indicate the Starrett poems that may be cut out.</p>

      <p>I know you now — you are John S. Brown! I enjoyed that stuff a lot, and it was never a question as to whether or not the two Brown pieces should be retained.</p>

      <p>Yes, I'll send on the Laureate Address. Two short and rather excellent speeches were made (one by Dean L. A. Sherman, the Shakespeare scholar) before I turned loose with my address. How would it do to include these? Considering the fact that the whole laureate affair <del>was</del>is unique in America, I should think it might be well to publish the lecture as the laureate Address with the introductory speeches.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>J.G.N.

      <p>The <u>Pack</u> impresses me much more favorably in print than in MS.</p>
