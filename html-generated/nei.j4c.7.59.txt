      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:â€”</span>


      <p>I have received proofs of the address in plenty of time. I'll have to hold this copy, as I intend to read the lecture a half dozen times between now and Dec. 9. If you think the delay unwise, you might have an extra copy of proof sent to me % prof. H. C. Dale, The University Moscow, Idaho.</p>







      <p>I'll be there Dec. 1. </p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With every kind thought,</span>

         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
