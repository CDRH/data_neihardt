      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

. . . . . . 

<p>I'm going to take a three weeks trip through the Indian country in July. Sig will drive me in our Ford, and we'll have a time. Can you accompany us? Both Sig and I are looking forward to the trip. I bought a Ford sedan - old model T - in fine shape with this in mind.</p>
