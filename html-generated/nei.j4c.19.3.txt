                <p>I'm delighted to hear from you again! I don't forget you and Mrs. Graves - faithful ones!</p>
               
                <p>My son and I will leave for a lecture trip in the East early Friday morning. If I don't get to see you, come on anyway. Mona will be here and happy to visit with you. She says: "Tell the <em class="hi">three</em> ladies to spend a night with me". There'll be plenty of room.</p>
                
                <p>If you come, Mona can tell you about the completion of the <u>Cycle of the West</u>.</p>
