                <span class="salute">Dear Lady:</span>
                
                <p>Every time I receive a letter from you, it's like a nice rain after a dry spell! Yours of the 17th was a sun shower — very good for this old man!</p>
                
                <p>There are so many things to say, that I don't know what to say first. Your comments on individualism mean a great deal to me. Indeed, I was <u>not</u> influenced by existentialism. On the contrary, I have regarded it as another manifestation of the anarchic spirit of our time. When I was elaborating my thesis on the mood of our <u>time</u> and its cause, existentialism had not yet become widely <del/> known and discussed over here. But I think of it as a further proof of my contention as found in so many of my articles in the P-D
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    (and in the Journal-Post and even the Minn. Journal). In the P-D there must be several articles on the subject, as I remember; and you seem to have at least one in mind when you refer to the sort of person who thinks he is intensely individualistic — a non-conformist — when, in fact, he is <del/> 
         <u>slavishly</u> 
         <em class="hi">conforming</em> 
         <u>to the dominant fashion among "sophiscates"</u>. I recall an article on the sort of self-styled socialist who is anarchic in his thinking — while socialism connotes the exact opposite. This <u>is</u> very common.</p> 
           
                <p>What you say about "a follower of the crowd" <del>is the</del> indicates that you must know
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    some of my articles bearing on this matter (Was this in the Goldenrod?) I have have always been, in fact and in expressed theory, an individualist. But I have always <u>been</u> profoundly aware that the individual is important only as a component of social and cosmic pattern. In Dr. House's book this was stated, as you will remember. This is it: <u>I</u> am nothing in myself; but as a part of a vast pattern, I can partake of the greatness of the pattern; and I am under what I may well regard as
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    divine compulsion to contribute as much to the pattern as it is possible for me, by effort and sacrifice, to contribute.</p> 
               
                <p>O Lucile, <u>dear lady</u>, I've done that, even tho' what I 
                    <u>was able</u> to do <del/>may not matter very much; but I know it matters far more than much that was done under a different compulsion.</p>
                
                <p>I'm genuinely glad for the message from Old Man Stewart, whether he actually told you to send it, or not. I know he feels that way, and he knows I am deeply fond of him — if he ever thinks about the matter. He is going to be <u>such a <del>fine</del>
         </u>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <u>fine man. I know he is</u>. And I'd feel greatly flattered if sweet, precious little Perky should have even the vaguest dream-like memory of me. She probably hasn't, but I'll bet she'll be sweet to me when I come back.</p>
                
                <p>Animals mean a very great deal to me (<u>Animals!</u> How funny!) Somewhere someone has remarked that a profound love of animals indicates a nearness to the other world. I <u>do</u> feel the thrill of truth in this. Last Sunday I went out to Skyrim to visit the darling horses. Four of them were obviously delighted to see me. They crowded against the paddock fence, thrusting their
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    noses <u>through</u> the bars and striving to get all the petting, each for himself. They all wanted to be kissed; <u>and they got kissed on the soft place</u> between the nostril and the mouth. It's a wonderful feeling. There's a touch of ecstacy in it!! The sweet things! Neither they nor I wanted anything in a selfish way. We just felt very close to each other.</p> 
               
                <p>Lucile, <u>that is something very good; And very beautiful too</u>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Lucile, I'm constantly being surprised and delighted as I go about the campus and the town, at the way people treat me. So very many, whom I do not know, speak to me as though they felt affection. Why should this be? It frightens me, sometimes — for I fear I may outlive the feeling people have towards me; and I often wish I could <em class="hi">go</em> 
         <u> before the mood changes</u>.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I do hope my heart will give out in time — before an anti-climax can begin!</p>  
                
                <p>As for Perky, you just wait until she really gets big, and knows it! I'll bet she will take care of her precious family! I'd hate to be a <del/>
         <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> around there when she is in full charge!!</p>
                
                <p>Old Yo-Yo has some gray <del/> hairs, but she is still very active in social affairs, and the she often tells me where to get off!</p>  
                <span class="closer">
                <span class="salute">Love to each of you — meaning Gramby too, of course.</span>
