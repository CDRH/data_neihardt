      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I've just been asked to write the articles on the Missouri River and the Platte for the Encyclopedia Britannica, new edition, and I'm tickled pink. Evidently there are others who regard the Missouri as my literary property!</p>

      <p>The other day, during the noon hour, I spieled before a wealthy woman's club here and got <del/>$100. It was another smash. They wouldn't let me go, and it is being said that the affair was "the best" they ever had there. This is extravagant praise, I'll say. They have had nearly <del>everyone</del>  every celebrity in Europe and America. Bertrand Russel came before me, and Count Keyserling follows.</p>

      <p>I have three lectures ahead - all in the state - for the next month. The Pennsylvania State College has offered me a 
    <div class="note">(over)</div>
    
    
    week's engagement for next August, summer session, and I'll accept. We can drive down - the whole family - and combine vacation with money-making. Next year I'll be free to push ahead with the Cycle, and believe me, the interest in that work is growing steadily all over. I'm constantly being reminded of this in ways that can not be doubted.</p>
