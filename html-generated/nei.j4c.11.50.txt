      <span class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn:</span>

      <p>Your letter of the 2nd reached me just after I mailed my note of this morning. I think your plan the better one, and we will let the matter go until October.</p>

      <p>I have been working harder than usual as the result of my absence on a lecture trip for three weeks, and lately I was obliged to lose more time on a trip to St. Louis.</p>

      <p>I do not know where I shall be this winter. I may be in Lincoln and I may be in St. Louis; but wherever I may be, I can arrange a trip to Wayne, no doubt.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With all kind thoughts for yourself and Mrs. Conn,</span>

         <span class="salute">Gratefully yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. Neihardt.
    John Neihardt.
