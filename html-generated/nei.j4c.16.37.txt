<span class="salute">Dear Dr. Conn:</span>
                
      <p>In my letter mailed yesterday I forgot to say that the copy of BLACK ELK SPEAKS inscribed to you and Mrs. Conn <u>was</u> mailed to you. Mr. Elliott received his copy, and he thought it very likely that your copy was taken to the library<del/> by mistake.</p>
                
      <p>Will you please let me know if one of the library copies contains the inscription to you. If you cannot locate it, I will send you another copy.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With kind thoughts,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
