      <span class="salute">Dear Mott:</span>

      <p>Idaho is seriously considering state adoption of <u>Hugh Glass.</u> 
         <em class="hi">You</em> can help tremendously, and I believe you will. Do you care to write a letter to Miss Redfield State Supt. of Public Instruction, Boise, Idaho, stating that you have heard of the possibilities in Idaho + telling of the results you have obtained with <u>Glass</u>? Also, could you not get others to do likewise - Mrs. Brown of Indianola, for instance?</p>

      <p>If I can ever be of service to you, be sure that I shall regard the opportunity as a source of genuine pleasure.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. N.
