      <span class="salute">Dear Old Man:—</span>
	

      <p>If the mail clerks had more understanding I would address you
"Sterling, Yosemite Valley" — but they wouldn't trouble, &amp; so I've got to aim this so that it will ricochet &amp; find you. I can't exaggerate my faith in the stuff you will do on that subject. It's your kind of material, &amp; you'll land something riffing. I rejoiced when I received your card, for I knew that you were incubating something big again. Go to it!</p>
	     <p>The Macmillan Company has accepted "The Song of Hugh Glass" for Fall <u>publication</u>. They offered "heartiest congratulations on what seems to us a distinct achievement". They might have been very stiff, you know. They will issue my Selected Poems later, it seems.</p>
	     <p>I knew you'd help me be glad about my "Song" &amp; so I'm telling you. Write me, won't you? I think of you more than of any other man. And no one places you higher than I do.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Always yours</span> 
         <br/>Jno 
</span>
      <p>There are 3,066 lines in the "Song" — two years of work.</p>
