                <span class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly:</span>
                
                <p>That <u>was</u> a good letter — yours of the 9th received only yesterday. (It's a long way out there!)</p>
                
                <p>You certainly hit the bull's eye when you pointed out that my world-view is 
                    <u>both</u> Aristotelian and Platonic. That is why I wrote 
                    <u>Poetic Values</u> — to show that there is <u>no gap between the two</u>, that our scale of values
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    is continuous. All our values, from "lowest" to "highest" — from common sense through science and on through the esthetic, the ethical, the religious values <u>are obviously</u> creations in consciousness from selected data of our experience. It is commonly assumed, without examination of that assumption, that our 
                    <u>sense values</u> are "objective" and therefore "real". But they are created in consciousness too.	
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Surely, nothing in the "sense world" is essentially as we conceive it. The <u>physicists back us 100% in this view</u>, as I showed 36 years ago in <u>Poetic Values</u>; and since then they have become more and more obviously supporters of that view. In brief, this is what happens, as I've set forth in <u>Poetic Values</u>;         
                    
                    
                       
                    
                    The horizontal line represents the state of consciousness in which the values at any point are 
                    <u>conceived</u>. It is commonly, and <u>wrongly</u>, supposed that there is only <u>one valid state of awareness</u> — the sense state of common sense and science. If this were true, there would be no art, no religion, no sense of beauty, <u>no love</u>.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
   
                    
                    Proceeding left to right, the consciousness arrives at a point where the preconception of "the world" as <u>solid</u>, "objective" fades out. The consciousness expands, is aware of larger relations, and out of this <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>other "<span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del> state (and higher ones) <u>creates the values pertinent to such</u> a state or states and the process is the
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    same essentially as that by which the "lower" more restricted values are conceived.</p>
               
                <p>Perhaps you will read <u>Poetic Values</u> with this sketch in view. This is <em class="hi">not</em> 
         <u>Idealism</u> in Bishop Berkeley's sense at all! It <u>is</u> obvious when one comes to think it. I know from my own experience that it is so. The expanded view of "the world" illuminates and gives meaning to the narrower, "lower" view.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I allowed myself to tell you <del/> about my athletic leanings in youth, because they were concerned with a vital part of the scale. And the same excess <del/> vitality that operated on the lower levels, has continued to operate on the higher levels — <u>even now</u>. It is all one pattern. Even what I called the happy "hell-raising" in the good <em class="hi">April</em> days with John Chaffee has its place in the
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    scheme of becoming. In considering my <u>world-view</u> as expressed in various ways throughout my life and my work, I think you are sure to note that there is, in the last analysis, no discrepancy. The 
                    <u>parts fit</u> into one pattern. And I suspect that your biography will trace that 
                    <u>becoming</u> and the shaping of the pattern. I am still working on the pattern, slowly fitting it to some larger pattern of which I am becoming more more aware.</p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>I will read the Poetics and comment modestly, I hope, in keeping with my own experience in that realm. His "melos, lexis, opsis" click with me already! And Plato's cave! Indeed, I know the inside of it very well. Also, I have often found the way out <u>through</u> the <u>poetic miracle</u> and also prayer. <u>Poetic Values</u> explains this also.</p>
               
                <p>As I remember now, the Albers Bureau was not concerned with a lecture trip for me, but with the possible management
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    of a scheme concocted by a brilliant and capable friend. He proposed to run a sort of school on wheels — a special train touring the country, with specialists to lecture to the travelling students <del>and</del>on numerous matters, geographic, social, artistic, pertaining to the regions visited. This <u>almost</u> succeeded. <u>I</u> was <del/> willing to give myself to the scheme, did what I could, and enlisted a number of prominent people willing to help. My friend
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    ended by committing suicide. I never knew why, but the trouble seemed to be with his wife. He never let me know. I wish he had.</p>
                
                <p>Feakins <u>lost</u> me on a Pacific tour, and I quit him to go to Long.
                    I enclose a clipping on Stephens. You will know I am quoted with less than accuracy! But 
                    <u>the intention is much</u>. Also I enclose a note on the <u>Law Wives'</u> talk.</p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>I'm glad you will see John  Chaffee. He may be of help. He should.</p>

                    <p>The Feakins connection was quite unsatisfactory to <u>both of us</u>. It was not important, except at the moment. He did <u>not</u> work for me, and <del>I</del>he lost <del>him</del>me on the tour.</p>
