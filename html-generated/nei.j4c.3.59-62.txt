      <span class="salute">Dear Sterling: —</span>

	     <p>So at last it has come to pass that my Scipionic cry — Hodie, hodie, Lillith scribenda est! — has had some effect?</p>
	     <p>Hooray! It's the very best kind of news. If you had told me that your rich Uncle had just given you a check for a hundred thousand, I would have been but little moved. But I know now that you are most probably writing your masterpiece, and that it is a matter for rejoicing. You proved long ago that you are a master of lyric





poetry, and now you will show them another side of you. It makes me happy, Old Man! It's just the proper theme for you.</p>
	     <p>I wish I had known that Stoddard's collection <del/> was not at all representative. I sent in a short review of it last week. The editor needs lambasting, evidently, and I've missed my chance. However the book gave me the feeling that Stoddard was a rare loveable man.</p>
	     <p>The fate to which you condemn the spinsters of Chicago is simply awful! Never to be <del/>! It is a matter for the S. P. C. A.!</p>




      <p>I'm still moving on with "The Song of Three Friends"; have over 1500 lines. Expect to reach the end in February, after two years of work. I sort of think you'll like the fellows in my yarn. Hope so, anyway.</p>
	     <p>I don't know about getting to the Coast. Red Cross work seems to interfere to some extent. But perhaps I'll get out there, &amp; if I do, I want to bat around with you a little.</p>
	     <p>As to the degree — doctor me no more doctors when you address me. If John Neihardt can't be made to signify anything, then Doc won't help much. Not that  I don't appreciate your courtesy. But once is enough to show you're right. It was nice of the University to give it to me, &amp; when clubs call me




"Doctor" I stand for it without a murmur.</p>
	     <p>Good luck to you always, Old Man, and once more, hooray for Lillith!</p>
      <span class="closer">
				     <span class="salute">Yours always</span>
				     <br/>Jno.
</span>
      <p>I can imagine how you must miss London!</p>
