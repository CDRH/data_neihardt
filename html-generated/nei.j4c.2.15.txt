      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Chapman:â€”</span>


      <p>I shall take charge of a literary department in the Minneapolis Journal on September first. I am planning a series of articles (to be illustrated with photographs) dealing with a very select number of poets and prose writers. The Journal, as you may know, has excellent standing and has the largest circulation in the Northwest. I hope to do a little good with my series.</p>

      <p>I want to do an article on you. I feel some pride in the fact that I was among the first to sound the trumpets over your "Learning and Other Essays". This time I should like to deal not only with your work, but with <u>you</u>. To do this I need data, biographical and otherwise, a photograph of you and one of your home where you do your work, some of the things that the better critics have said about your work etc.etc. I assure you that I shall not be fulsome. I would not insult you with cheap praise or mushy comment. Perhaps you would instruct your publishers to send me one or two more books (review copies).</p>

      <p>By doing this for me you will be putting me under obligations; but I shall endeavor to do you good in return.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Faithfully,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G Neihardt
