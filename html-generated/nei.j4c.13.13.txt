      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I cannot see how it is possible for me to do the Robinson article. Last week I received a letter from Encyclopedia Britannica asking why I had not turned in the articles on the Missori and Platte Rivers for the new edition. I see no possibility of writing those articles, and you know how much the opportunity means to me. The fact is, I am worn thin all the time and never get any relief from the tension of me job. And there is no relief in sight. It is either over-work or over-worry for me.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">I love you all the time,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
