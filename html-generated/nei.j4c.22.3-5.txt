                <p>Evidently you went through the final test like a ship under full sail in a high, following wind! Reid sent me a copy of the program with the remark, "you would have been proud of Lucile, as we were." Moffet was happy, and we were happy together.</p>

                    <p>The television course prospers. I completed <u>Three Friends</u> right on the dot yesterday (Wed.) and will begin <u>Hugh Glass</u> today. In television, radio, and newspaper publicity <del>it</del> the reference is to "the very popular <del/> telecourse". One housewife wrote the station that she "just loved the way the <del/> elderly gentleman <del/> reads poetry"! They are happy out at the station, and are giving me fine support with visuals, sound effects etc. Lambert and Ellis changed
                    
                    
                     the time from 4:30-5:00 to 5:00-5:30. Many had complained that they couldn't make the earlier time. We  begin Oct. 13 with the new time.</p>
               
                <p>I like to believe that you had a pleasant, though hurried, trip back home, and I'm eager to hear from Doctor Aly.</p>
