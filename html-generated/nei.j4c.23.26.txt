                <p>Dr. Robinson is changing the date of my talk â€” probably to Thurs., Feb. 26th. Any time you can let me meet your class will suit me. I'm eager to know some of your students. I've changed my ticket for <del/> return from Portland, Sat. morning, the 28th

                    I'm wondering if I must go up to Portland on Friday. You'll know.</p>
                
                <p>It is going to be a joy to see you and Lucile!! Robin, of course, is counting the days.</p>
