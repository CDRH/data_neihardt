      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Mott: â€”</span>


	     <p>I was very glad to receive your letter of yesterday, and was surprised to learn that you wrote me from McGregor, Iowa. This is the first letter I have received from you since you were here. During the past month two other letters addressed to me (both containing drafts) have been lost, and I fear that at least one other letter has gone astray.</p>
	     <p>It's the best of news that you will write <em class="hi">two</em> articles about my work. The more the better: and especially when the work is done by a man of real understanding. I feel quite safe in your hands, Mott.</p>
	     <p>The prospect for the success of the epic cycle is surprisingly good and grows better steadily.</p>
	     <p>"The Song of the Indian Wars" is going on in a most satisfactory way, and I count it a great privilege to have so tremendous a theme to handle. Four hundred twenty five lines in four months! Two glorious years of work left! It's fine to be alive, have a big job to do, and know how to do it.</p>
	     <p>Be sure that I am deeply grateful for your friendship and cooperation.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Always yours,</span>
				
         <br/>Jno G. Neihardt
</span>


      <p>My people were glad to be remembered and all send kindest regards.</p>


      <p>I feel sure that you will have little difficulty in finding a place for the second article. Am eager to see both. The four Macmillan books (poetry) are all going into new editions.</p>
