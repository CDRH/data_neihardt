                <p>I've just read yours of yesterday in which you mention The Alliance Book Corp as at least a possibility, and offer to send a classified directory.</p>
                
                <p>It has struck me that the only way for me to find out is to go and see, and I could get a lot done in a few days. So I've just about decided to run up there for a few days and <del/> see what I can see.</p>
                
                <p>I may be able to get away in time to have a visit with you on Sunday.</p>
