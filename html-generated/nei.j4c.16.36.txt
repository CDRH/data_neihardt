      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
 
      <p>It was good as always to receive your letter.</p>

      <p>My long silence was due chiefly to the fact that I was really deep in the MESSIAH. It has been moving on in a way that has surprised me. For several months progress was slow; by which I mean to say that the times when I could break through the wall were scattered. Nevertheless, I did make real progress and got on paper what I wanted there. But about a month ago the wall broke down and I know now that I am definitely on the other side of it. THE SONG OF THE MESSIAH will be worth doing and will justify almost anything that might come to me. Curiously enough, something thus far seems to be looking out for me and mine. If this actually continues through the present social darkness, I shall accept it as a miracle.</p>
                
      <p>I have just returned from the University of Missouri where I lectured twice before the summer school, with the usual results. I was there on May 2 and this was a return engagement. On the way I stopped at the Negro University at Jefferson City and had a good time. They say I am to come back next winter.</p>
                
      <p>Tomorrow Sigurd and I start North for a lecture trip of two weeks. I shall see Black Elk though he cannot see me now. Ben, the son of Black Elk, has a new boy baby and he has named him John Neihardt Black Elk. The letter Ben wrote about this is worth reading. There is good stuff in the little fellow, for he has in him something of the blood of Crazy Horse, and I hope, much of his Grandfather who is a seer. Not many white men can claim such relationships. What wordly good this may do the little chap is, of course, another question. I hope I may be able to help him on when he needs help later. I am genuinely thrilled by the idea that one of Crazy Horse's blood should bear my name.</p>
                
      <p>I have read your Black Elk article several times lately, and you say the right thing, I am sure, and with the genuine glow.</p>
                
      <p>There seems to be little worth saying about our social condition. Ruling classes learn only in one way, as history shows. But this is not by any means the end of the world and the goodness in human nature, both active and potential, is not to be denied.</p>
                
      <p>Good luck to you with the novel, and when you go East give every kind thought to the Three.</p>
