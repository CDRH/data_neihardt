      <span class="salute">Dear Dr. House: -</span>

	     <p>It was good news that "Eight Hundred Rubles" took hold of you. When I was in Minneapolis I saw in the Journal an Associated Press dispatch, from somewhere in Russia, which gave me the plot. I thought about it off and on all that winter, and when I got back here in the summer I was full of it. Wrote the thing in three weeks, working half days. That was just before I began "Hugh Glass".</p>
	     <p>I have another drama called "The Death of Agrippina", and I'm trying to get a copy of it for you. It appeared in a special number of the Chicago magazine, POETRY. I expect to issue the two dramas in a volume to be called "Two Mothers".</p>
	     <p>"Eight Hundred Rubles" was accepted for production by the Toy Theatre of Boston last year. The Toy failed, and I have not tried it on any other theatre. Minnie Maddern Fiske saw the little play and wrote enthusiastically about it, but she saw no chance for using so short a piece in her repertory.</p>
	     <p>I'm glad if my interest in your book has any stimulating effect, and can understand how that might be. I have always found that another man's belief is of very great value. Certainly I believe in your ability to do something significant in that line, and am very eager to hear that you are in sight of the end.</p>
	     <p>The Club received your letter and discussed the matter last night. All the members are enthusiastic, I hear, and without doubt something will be done. However, the members seem to have scruples about making it a pay affair. They want to give it to the town — and that's nice of them, surely. They will have some money one of these days before long, and it seems they want to pay out of the treasury for the recital.</p>





	     <p>They tell me that you said nothing about the possibility of your coming along to give an introductory lecture. Where did I get that idea? It's a good one, and I hope that will be the way of it. While I am on this subject, I must ask you to express to Miss Mack something of my pleasure in meeting her, and my appreciation of her interest. I needn't say how I look forward to her reading of my stuff.</p>
	     <p>I received today a copy of Connington's translation of the "Agamemnon" which I had sent from England. It was the only translation I had to fear, and I fear it no longer. Not one of them has translated literally and in the original rhythms! Most of them — practically all of them — simply lacked skill in verse construction. There is a fine chance left for me. When you come, I want to point out to you several of my readings of lines that seem to have tripped the others up. In one instance it seems that I have actually made a discovery, however bumptious the statement may sound!</p>
	     <p>This afternoon I finished my review work for the week, and tomorrow morning I begin on "The Song of Three Friends" again. Tonight I am chatting a bit with you before I go to bed.</p>
	     <p>Don't worry about that check; it was generous enough, and considering all the kindness, I was overpaid.</p>
	     <p>All kind thoughts for Mrs. House and yourself and Mary.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. Neihardt
