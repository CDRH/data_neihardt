      <span class="dateline">Bancroft, Oct. 12, 20.</span>

      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Mott: â€”</span>


	     <p>Yours of the 9th has just come.</p>
	     <p>We did not think you unappreciative. On the contrary, we regretted that we could not give you a better welcome. Come again &amp; plan to stay longer.</p>
	     <p>I'm looking forward to the Dec. number of the Review.</p>
	     <p>When the new edition of the "Friends" is ready, I'll send you a copy. This should be very soon, tho' there might be a delay.</p>
	     <p>Braithwaite has asked me for exclusive rights to dispose of moving picture versions of the two narrative poems. He seems very enthusiastic. Now while I despise the movies in their present state, I see




how B's idea could be of great advantage to my Life <span class="unclear illegible">[?]</span>, and I have turned him loose to do what he can.</p>
	     <p>The enclosed Transcript article might interest you. Please return it in your next.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Always yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. N.
