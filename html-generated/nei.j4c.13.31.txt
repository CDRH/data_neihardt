      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I am hurrying this news to you because I know it will make your face glow in the way I like to remember when I'm blue.</p>

      <p>I have just received a long night letter from Curtis Hidden Page, President of the Poetry Society of America, inviting me to be the honor guest of the Society for a whole week, beginning Sat. Jan. 26th. Am to speak at least once daily and sometimes twice, before different bodies, and Leonora Speyer (an arbitress of fashion!) will give a reception in my honor as a crowning event. The latter, I understand, at the Biltmore. This looks as though the most powerful literary gang in America wants to let me inside.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With endless love,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>
      <p>The idea is that I give "a complete exposition of my work".</p>
