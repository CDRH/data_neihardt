      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
      <p>I was glad for the characteristic note from you with the old warmth of heart in it. Visitors and the attendant distractions, also a lecture trip, have had something to do with my silence. Still, you <u>did</u> get something from me in a clairvoyant manner, as you have often done. It is often hard to shake off the profound disgust over the state of human society. Little less than idiocy! And what hope?</p>
                          
      <p>Macmillans sent me a contract &amp; cash advance for the Messiah &amp; tied me up for the next book also.</p>
                
      <p>Truly, as far as my own affairs go, I have no reason to be at all sad.</p>
                
      <p>The opening chapter of your Oklahoma novel is certainly promising, &amp; I'm eager for the rest.</p>
                
      <p>How fine that Morrie et al. received the Pulitzer Prize for "Of Thee I Sing" Mary must be very happy.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Endless love, good comrade!</span>
         <br/>Jno.
