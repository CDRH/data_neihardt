                <p>That was a good and very welcome letter. You did, somehow, seem a bit far away. But you will all be here soon.</p>
                
                <p>Had some fine experiences last Thurs. (7-30-'59). Hilda &amp; I drove to Judge Hall's home on Lake Lotawana on Wed. p. m., and <del/> next morning we called on President Truman. He knew about me, in a general way, and especially in connection with Tom Benton. It was a happy 15 minute conversation we had, and we really <u>clicked</u>. I forgot that he is a world figure and that he <del/> once had
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    more power than any Roman emperor ever had. He was <u>sweet</u> with me, and <del/> in that short time I felt much about him that I'm glad to know. I really <u>saw inside by flashes</u>, and I 
                    <u>loved what I saw</u>. We shook hands twice as our group was leaving; and he came to the door, took my hand a third time &amp; said, "When I come to Columbia again I'll look you up." Look me up! (Being important did not damage <u>his</u> spirit.)</p>
                
                <p>The Judge's daughter, Lynn (my student) and her mother drove us around to all the
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    places where I lived all under the age of 10 years. The places are all living, except the one at Howard &amp; Olive where I last saw my father. (The house next door is still hanging on wearily). The house at 2538 Wabash is now owned by a Negro preacher, Rev. Harris; and my god! You must see how he has dressed that place up! It's funny in a way that does not make you want to laugh. Evidently he loves the place not wisely and too well! He was not at home, but
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I hope to see him and say something pleasantly appreciative. To think the old place should be so loved! Golly. I lived there 70 years ago, and it's all clear as yesterday afternoon. Our best friends, the Fincks, lived at 2540, and that, too is thriving with a new owner.</p>

         <u>And</u>, Lucile, I stood under the windows of Miss Lobb's room at Irving School on 24th &amp; Prospect. It's a Negro school now &amp; the name is changed to Booker T. Washington. I've tried to get into the bldg., but could
