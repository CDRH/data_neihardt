      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
      <p>I believe that a series of articles on your pioneer experiences would make an excellent feature for the magazine, &amp; I hope you will go ahead. Such memories are decidedly worth recording and you will do it with a warmth of feeling that will make them come alive.</p>
                
      <p>The enclosed shows how Morrows are going at their job. You may shove it into your next letter.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Love always</span>

         <br/>Jno.
