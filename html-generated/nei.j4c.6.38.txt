Dec. 15 20.</span>

      <span class="salute">Dear Mott: —</span>

	     <p>I've just read the Grinnell article again — and its certainly exquisitely done. Some day you will do an extended thing, showing the goal I sought &amp; how far I came from it. You may begin when "The Indian Wars" is in print — who knows?</p>
	     <p>I'm grateful for you.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. Neihardt

      <p>N. Y. Evening Post &amp; Boston Transcript go strong for the "Wayfaring". The former calls it "an American Odyssey"!!</p>
