                <p>It hasn't rained yet, and this poor old man feels awful! Maybe if you would drop me a short letter with a kind word in it, the rain would come after weeks and weeks and weeks of drouth. Isn't it worth trying?</p>
                
                <p>I'm off for New York Cy. tomorrow. Wed. evening I'll talk about Black Elk to the Westerners at 
                
                
                
                
                their annual dinner. Then on the 13th and 14th I'll see what I can do at the U. N.! <u>Someone</u> ought to do something, don't you think? — or at least <u>try</u>! Kruschev is leaving just as I'll be arriving. Evidently he doesn't know I'm coming!</p> 
                    
                    <p>Did I tell you we have installed an oil furnace? </p>
                
                    <p>The classes are wonderful. Dear, dear young people.</p>

                    <p>Dean English told Lambert the other day that a "video" must be made soon of the whole Cycle. On Monday I'm to be interviewed for 
                    KMOX T. V. — something fairly short, I suppose.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Cook was thrown by a new mare two weeks ago and has just been released from the hospital. He has a broken collar <del>bo</del>bone, and it was necessary to operate for a twist in the bowels. He is doing remarkably well and spends the sunny afternoons out here.</p>
