                               <span class="dateline">Sunday, 11-17-57</span>
                                
                                
                                <span class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly:</span> 
      <p>Yours of the 10th is here, and it is full of very good news! On the 11th I wrote more on the socialism-totalitarianism theme, 10 pages <del/> which I am holding for Enid to copy. Even with this, so much is left to say by way of applying the thesis to world affairs etc. But the <del/> rapidly written sketch does expand the idea a bit &amp; suggest universal application.</p>
                                
                <p>Here are answers following the order of your questions of Nov. 12th:</p>
                                    <ul>
         <li>(1) I'll write a special letter on my adventure with the hysterical group during World War I — not too important, but of some significance I believe.</li>
         <li>(2) <p>The story of Trudeau and the rattlesnake was told to me by Howard Morton whose eye was shot out in the Beecher Island Fight. I met him &amp; his daughter in California, in 1917, I believe. Where, I forget — either S. F. or L. A. But the story <u>is</u> printed somewhere in some historical society collections. Could be Kansas Hist. Soc. I hope one of my letters in the collection at M. U. tells of my visit with Morton.</p>

                                    <p>Give Mary Ryskind our abiding love. Her daddy was a dear, dear, wonderful person.</p> 
                                        
                                    <p>Fine about the 2 <del/> Sterling letters found at Mills College! How <u>did</u> they get there, I wonder? Mills wanted me to come over &amp; give a lecture, but I was compelled to move on to Portland etc.</p>
         </li>
         <li>(3) John Galen Howard would <u>not</u> throw my letters away. We were very close. He called me "Beloved John". I suspect the daughter's search was not thorough.</li>
         <li>(4) The Bob Davis letters! Hurrah! I do hope Davis saved the one in which I assailed his shallow criticism of <u>The Alien</u> (which he <u>did</u> buy &amp; publish). It <u>was</u> a good one — headlong and true. You may have seen his reply, which should be in the M. U. collection. He said in substance: "Why did you jump on me like that? I'm not a literary man, I'm only a journalist." His reply was most humble and characteristically amusing.</li>
         <li>(5) <p>Fine that you will do that article requested by Mr. Morrison!</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                        
                                        
                                    
                                    <p>It's so good that are actually reading my old Bancroft Blade! I was 22 years old when I took it over, and I was having a swell time with it! Where did you find the McKinley poem? I wrote it for the Omaha Daily News in 1901 (wasn't it?). I was living in a garret room with <del/> only a sky<del/>light at the time, I recall. I also wrote "Lonesome in Town" in that god-awful place. Didn't stay there long, however. I don't recall the "other poems" you mention, but will when I see them. Yes, I remember Bixby — a most remarkable character. Ran a daily column on the Neb. State Journal. He was the first <del/> widely known versifying columnist in the country, and <u>very</u> clever. I knew him slightly and admired him greatly. I do <u>not</u> recall the "poem" from the card game. Quote a line or two that I may remember, please.</p>
         </li>
         <li>(6) <p>The Blade editorials, especially on Russia, showing the early phase of my thought about world matters — How come? you ask. The answer is that I was something of the "intellectual socialist"!! I mean, I was deep in social <del/> and economic literature — as well as history; and I was always, as far back as I can remember, eager to find the <u>larger patterns</u> back of events. I was doing a lot of reading, thinking, and dreaming. No doubt Prof. Jim Pile's remark about Russia and the U. S. was in my thoughts somewhere. In the <del/> Russo-Jap War, I was not a partisan. It was a <u>tremendous spectacle</u> for me. I pitied <del/> the Russians when their fleet was sunk. I <u>admired</u> the <u>Japs</u> for their high morale and fighting qualities.</p>
                                       
                                            <p>It's good <del/> that you will be here at Xmas! Of course we'll have a talk.</p>
