      <div class="note">Prolific American author, born in Maryland, most famous for the muckraking novel The Jungle (1906).  Won the 1943 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.  During his college years, he wrote dime novels and stories for pulp magazines to earn money for tuition.  An idealistic socialist, the social and political critique of his novels led to real-world action, leading to the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration, the California chapter of the ACLU, the End Poverty movement during the Dust Bowl era, and exposés against yellow journalism etc.  
    
    Sinclair had a strong interest in occult phenomena and telepathy. Mental Radio (1930) recounts his wife Mary’s telepathic ability and experiences.  This book was influential in leading to the establishment of Duke University’s parapsychology department.</div>
