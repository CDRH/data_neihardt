                <p>Another dear letter from you â€” and I do love them! Everything goes on here in keeping with an overall pattern, I believe. My classes are a source of much satisfaction to <del/> me, and, I hope, to some of my students. I have at least <u>two</u> really good writers in my Critical Essay class, and even the least gifted in writing show a creative interest in ideas chosen in the hope of expanding the everyday awareness of things. My Epic America students <u>do</u> seem interested. I always wonder about this.</p>
                               
                <p>Our colts are growing joyously. My God! how they <u>do love</u> to <u>live</u>! Galloping, kicking, pooping, snorting - with tails like banners waving in a wind of glory!</p>

                <p>Mrs. Aly (now at the University of Oregon) is pushing ahead with her research, completing her dissertation (doctorate) on my work from the viewpoint of speech, <u>and</u> preparing for the biography she will write later. I'm fortunate to have found her for she is devoted, thorough, and gifted. I have the task of writing to her about many things bearing on my life and my writing, as questions come to her in her research.</p>
                                
                <p>The family is well. Yo-yo (the DOG) is growing wiser and sweeter, and I wonder how a little skin can enclose so much love. (Of course it <u>doesn't enclose</u> at all.)<del/>

                <p>I think so often of you and your Lady. You are dear, dear.</p>
