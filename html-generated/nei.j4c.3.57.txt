      <span class="salute">Dear Sterling:—</span>



      <p>Where are you, what are you doing — and what the deuce, anyway? It's been long since I heard from you. I wonder if you are in the Army. Have just been reading Chas. Warren Stoddard's Poems, with your fine tribute in the front.</p>

      <p>I'm still toiling away on "The Song of Three Friends". Over 1500 lines now. Can't finish until in February. Good luck!</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Affectionately</span>
         <br/>John Neihardt
