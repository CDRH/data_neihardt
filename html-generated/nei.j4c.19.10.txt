                <p>I think it's a swell idea to ask Masefield, and I should think he'd be nice about it.</p>
               
                <p>As for the Anthology, use my "Easter" from "Collected Poems".</p>
                
                <p>I finished <u>The Song of Jed Smith</u> on April 16th, and the book is to appear in September. So the Cycle of the West is completed.</p>
                
                <p>I'm staying awhile at 9917 Emerson Ave., Overland, Missouri (suburb of St. Louis).</p>
