                <p>Have had a most successful time here. The affair Wed. evening at the Annual <u>Westerners</u> dinner was a real 
                    <u>smash</u>. The response was surprising to me.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I talked off-hand about Black Elk, and it was "one of those things" Some important people came out to see me, Mari Sandoz and Homer Croy among others.</p>
                
                <p>I tried to get into the U. N. yesterday, but police swarmed about the place.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>Am leaving at 12:20 for Ithaca. Will talk there to classes on the 17th &amp; 18th. The public talk will be on Wed evening. Then I'll come back here for the flight home.</p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>Macmillans sent a lady from the editorial dept to greet me. <u>Can't</u> we induce you to give us another book?" I answered, "Tease me, I might."</p>
