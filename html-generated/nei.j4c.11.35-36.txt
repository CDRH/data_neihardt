      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:-</span>

      <p>I am buried in proofs. I still have the plates of INDIAN TALES to read, and I have nearly all the galleys of the COLLECTED POEMS here. This must be done in addition to my regular work which, in itself, is a good deal too much. But I'm not forgetting what I am to do for you. I shall write a little leading article for my page dealing with the question you want me to answer for your book. Thus, I can kill two birds with the proverbial single stone. That will be very soon now.</p>

      <p>I wish you could see the new volumes in the New English Men of Letters Series now being issued by Macmillans. They are compact and, in the main, wonderfully well done. I think the volume on Meredith is the best thus far. Shall I send it to you to read and return? It is just about the length that your new MAN AND POET will probably be, and a reading of it might be of use.</p>

      <p>Macmillans are doing the COLLECTED POEMS in a most generous way, evidently not trying to save expense. You will remember that Robinson's page in his Collected Poems was in small type and too compact for <del>read</del>easy reading. In mine Macmillans use type considerably larger than in THE QUEST. The type page is a good deal wider than in any of my other books. It will be a handsome volume, surely.</p>

      <p>Have you seen the booklets they have issued on my stuff? If not, ask for a supply.</p>
