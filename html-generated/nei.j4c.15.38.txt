                <p>I've been thinking a great deal of you, and I'm wondering if the bad arm is giving you a lot of hell. I do hope not.</p>
                
                <p>It would be great if you could be free to go north with Enid, Hilda, and me in May. I suppose this is not possible. A comfortable fast car &amp; camping! Not like our Ford journey!</p>
                
                <p>This carries love as always.</p>
