                <span class="salute">Dear Bower:</span>
                
                <p>It was dear of you — and characteristic — to work for me out there, as you have done. I <u>do</u> appreciate your goodness, and if they invite me, I'll accept it with pleasure. If they <u>don't</u> invite me — and they well may not — I'll plan to zizz out there anyway. I do want to take a look at you dear people in your new and beautiful home. So I'll zizz (golly, what a fine word, invented by your precious lady!) out, look at each of you with a warm, devouring gaze,
                
                
                
                
                exchange a few happy words with you all, and zizz right back here to wish I'd stayed longer, <u>much</u>, much longer!</p>
                
                <p>With or without an invitation, I think Spring would be the best time. Still, I do get a lost feeling now and then — and I might decide to zizz while it's still deep winter.</p>
                
                <p>Anyway, it's going to be quite all right one way or the other, and bless your heart for being so good to this old man!</p>
