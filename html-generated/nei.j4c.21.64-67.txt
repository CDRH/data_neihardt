                <span class="salute">Dear Slade:</span>
                
                <p>Your dear letter means everything to me. Bless you. All you say is true, and I am so glad you wrote about the <u>glow of spirit</u> in her face. It was so strikingly characteristic that even strangers have remarked about it. It was the spirit shining through. (She had been preparing to go for a long while — getting things straightened out — boxes &amp; barrels of papers &amp; trinkets — all our rings made
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    strong for the children. A ring had lost a diamond. <u>That</u> had to be reset, because the ring would go to Sigurd after I was through wearing it. She gave me orders about the funeral long before her illness. All this was done with no hint of morbidity. We <del>both</del> 
         <u>believed together</u> and we <u>knew</u>, and I <u>know</u>. I told her that when the time should come, I wanted her to go first. I did not want her to go through the
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    earthly suffering of the change. So she has gone ahead, and I will do my best as long as I am needed here.</p>
             
                <p>The funeral was beautiful — masses of flowers. A minister friend of mine spoke. Then 
                    <u>I spoke directly to her</u> for 3 minutes &amp; read three lyrics. She had asked me to read. Then our boy, Sigurd, the pianist, played a Bach prelude that she loves.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    And our daughter Hilda sang gloriously a song <del>she</del> Mona loves. She was with us and <u>is</u>.</p> 
              
                <p>I must answer your question about the title of my lecture. Let's call it <u>Poetry as a Vocal Art</u>, illustrated by readings of his own lyrics. <del/> The poetry will win over those who come, but how to induce them to come —? A doctor's thesis is now being written on my reading of poetry. And, of course, 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I've read for years to audiences all over the country. The lyrics <u>always</u> won them over.</p>
               
                <p>This is the best I can do just now. If you think it proper, you may use these facts: <u>I'm a</u> member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters; a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets (N. Y.); Vice-Pres (for the Midwest) of the Poetry Society of America; a fellow (recently selected)

                <p>This sounds boastful. I'm just trying to give you some support in your task of promotion.</p>
