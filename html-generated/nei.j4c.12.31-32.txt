      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
 
      <p>I've been <u>very</u> lazy, deliberately so, for nearly 3 wks. I will drive back to St. Louis Friday.</p>

      <p>
         <em class="hi">Yes</em>, you are right. You will write a fine book about the whirl called Neihardt + the work. Also, nothing can stop this thing. The work will last beyond all but a very few things of our generation. This delay is essential, and will lead to
    
    
    
    greater things as you will see later.</p>

      <p>I have signed for year after next with the Affiliated Lyceums of Cleveland. Am now about to become national director of a new + very promising scheme. (I plan to work you in. Shall wait for more definite developments before writing you.</p>

      <p>You <u>must</u> be with Macmillans, if possible. But a year or two or three may bring out better ways 
    
    
    Bully for the notes to the <u>Wars!</u> Make them copious enough to be fairly fool-proof with crude teachers. Ask me any questions and I'll reply at once.</p>

      <p>
         <u>The best is yet to be with us, Comrade</u>!</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Love always,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
