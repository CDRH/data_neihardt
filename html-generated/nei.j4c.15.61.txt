                <span class="salute">Dear Ben:-</span>
                
                <p>Those were good letters I received from you and we were very glad to get them. When we left you at Hill City we felt just about as you and Black Elk did for we were really very lonesome, but there will be another time I know and it is not impossible that you will see the whole family next summer.</p>
                
                <p>I am enclosing a letter lately received from my publisher, which will explain itself. Note what is said about moving picture possibilities. Morrow is a knowing man and will do the best possible with our idea. I think what he says about using the whole book for movies rather than the horse dance alone is probably a good suggestion. Anyway, everything possible will be done to put this over. After reading the letter carefully, please explain it all to Black Elk and after you have done this return the letter to me. I want Black Elk to know how the publisher feels about the stories of him that I am writing. There seems to be good reason to believe that a great many people are going to know about your father within the next two years, and I think this book is going to make him a happier man. It certainly will if I have anything to do with it and I think I have a good deal to do with it. I am very fond of him and also I admire him greatly. I began my daily column after my return by writing an article about him which seemed to attract more than usual attention. I made a copy and sent it to him.</p>
               
                <p>I am eager to hear what you may learn from the [allotments(?)] who own[s] the section across from you. Wouldn't it be [strange(?)] if I should actually live there some time at least during a portion of the year?</p>
                
                <p>With affectionate thoughts for you and your wife and Olivia.</p>
