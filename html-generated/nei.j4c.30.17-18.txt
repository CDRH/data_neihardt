                <p>
         <u>Have</u> you heard from Potter? Oh I do wish he'd see the possibilities in the book! Let me know when you hear.</p>
                
                <p>A nice girlie by the name of Beamer (I believe) wrote me about your giving her a copy of <u>Easter</u> and the Sioux prayer. She expressed the wish that I come back soon (<em class="hi">All of us</em> wish it, she said)
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <u>"All"</u> is a lot of folks, but the girl was in the Oral Interpretation class, and maybe <u>most</u> of the class is what the girl meant.</p>
                
                <p>I think and think of you two, and you are dear.</p>
                
                <p>Arrangements are being made now (legal) for the gift of my library and papers to the University "The Neihardt Memorial Library" to be made a nucleus for a growing Western Americana collection</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>I finally finished the new preface for the new edition of <u>Black Elk Speaks</u>. <u>I had to <em class="hi">drive</em> myself</u>. I do feel nearer the Other World than to this one very often. I'm happy in my classes and the students <u>are dear</u>.</p>
                
                <p>
         <u>How are you</u>? Any snow yet? Good Indian summer here, except that we had a puff
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    of cold air in the north yesterday, <del/> but it's already warmer.</p>
