      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>

      <p>I was sorry to fail you in the matter of the quatrain; but I have no heart of that sort of thing, however I may admire good things of the sort when done by others. I hope my message reached you while Markham was still in the house. It was timed to arrive during the tea-flight.</p>

      <p>I enclose 1.25 for another Address, which please mail to

      <span class="salute">My dear Mr. Neihardt:</span>

      <p>Mrs. Markham sends us her notice to let you have our volumes of poetry for 1921 for use in judging the best book of poems of the year. I think they have already been sent her and you too. The Poet's Pack is out of the running, I fancy, as it is for single poets. <u>Candles in the Sun</u>, by William Griffith, and our brochure <u>In Gossamer Grey,</u> by Oscar Williams, are, I think, the only ones we have to enter in the competition. I think they are already in your group for consideration, but if not of course I'll be glad to send them.</p>

      <div class="note">I have neither of these. Please send to me; I am to forward books to other judges.</div>
