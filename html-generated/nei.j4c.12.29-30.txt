      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I see that in my haste I failed to reply to your question as to books for your School Library. Here is the best possible answer I can give:</p>

      <p>Get from E.P. Dutton + Co., New York, their complete list of Everyman's Library.</p>

      <p>Get from Henry Holt + Co their complete list of the Home University Library.</p>

      <p>From the American-Scandinavian Foundation (25 West 45th St., N.Y) get list of their publications from G.P. Prutman's Sons, N.Y., get list of Loeb Library.</p>



      <p>With these lists before you, it will be easy for <u>you</u> to check <del>what</del> suitable volumes.</p>

      <p>Also, get from E.P. Dutton + Co. list of the New Universal Library (pub. abroad by Routledge, London) (This <u>may</u> be out of print but I think not)</p>

      <p>These "libraries" are, as you know, the best going and cover a wide range. Also, with exception of Loeb Library + The<del>S</del> American-Scandinavian publications, prices are reasonable. All are well made books and good editions. You can't go wrong on these lists.</p>
