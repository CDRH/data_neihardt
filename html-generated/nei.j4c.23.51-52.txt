                <p>This is just a note on your lyric program, to be slipped in with my next letter. I'm in my office while my grader is conducting a test.</p>
                
                <p>You will follow through "from young love to married love." In doing this, perhaps you will find pertinent passages in <u>Gaea</u>. I did mean all of that and it was all about Mona <u>before</u> she came out to me.</p>
                
                <p>(I doubt that anything from <u>Nuptial Song</u> can be used).</p>
                
                <p>Your plan is excellent. No one else has commented on that vital progression.
                
                
                    
                
                
                O, Lucile, <u>you do know</u>!</p>
                
                <p>Your emphasis on "In the Night" means much to me. That happened so. All that summer we slept in hammocks under a cluster of cherry trees heavily laden with fruit. (The cherries ripening!) And I did see that in the starlight.</p>
                
                <p>But this is the chief point in my note: The progression goes farther, as you know — so much farther. This is expressed in the lyrics <u>as a high aspiration</u>. And it <u>has</u> happened to me. I'll never write a lyric about 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    it, altho' something of it should get into the poem, "I Shall Be Young with You" — if I am able to write it. It's really for the singing that is silence. But I could <u>describe</u> it fairly well, for it is not vague. Its something like a radiation from an intensely living center, burning white, <del/>and making every living thing seem dear.</p>

                <p>This is the 18th of March, and now I have your letter. 1.— I am happy to know that Bower is gaining 
                    
                    
                    
                    steadily. 2. Already I am admiring the lovely lavender dress that you will wear, with the amethyst, for the lyric program. 3. I am listening, too, and I know there is nothing but good to hear. In this connection: You once remarked that Enid has wisdom. Today, when we two had lunch together here she began talking with no prompting <u>about the most vital matters</u>, and I wish you could have heard her. It was true and beautiful. <u>It could have been Mona talking</u>. You should know her well. I marvel at her understanding and when she is in such a mood, she humbles me.</p>
