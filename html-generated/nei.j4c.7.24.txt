      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:â€”</span>


      <p>It was damned sweet of you to write me a fine letter so soon after I let you down. Hurrah for the new house! Count on me to occupy that room before another year has passed, and I'll nose about among those books with glee.</p>

      <p>I knew well that I'd miss something by staying away from the banquet. You'll have a bully time, I know.</p>

      <p>I've been thinking that since you can not use the Poetry lecture until fall, perhaps you'd better let me have it back. I'll need it for the lecture tours next fall, and I have thought of some changes I'd like to make. If you still think you can handle it when fall comes, you may have it <del>back</del>again.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With every good wish,</span>

         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. Neihardt
