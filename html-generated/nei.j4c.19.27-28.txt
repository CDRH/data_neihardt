                <span class="salute">Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Seymour:</span>
            
                <p>Our youngest daughter, Alice, will go to Chicago this week, and I have asked her to get acquainted with you. I know she will like you, and I feel that you will like her. Allowing generously for parental prejudice, she is as fine a person as I know. If she meets you two, she will have the feeling of your kindness and strength to carry with her in her first independent adventure. You may remember that I spoke to you of her work in ballet — four strenuous years of it — now. She has appeared several times with the opera ballet at the Municipal Auditorium 
                    
                    
                        in St. Louis, and has attracted attention. Now her teacher, Madame Cassan, is sending her to a teacher in Chicago who will undertake to place her.</p>
                
                <p>Alice was one of my boys until she went "all out" for being a young lady! Her sister, Hilda, was another — and she was married here last Saturday! I wish you could see those two girls handling Indian horses! Surely the Indian boys were flabbergasted.</p>
                
                <p>I don't know when I may see you again, but I hope it may not be too long.</p>
                
                <p>Anyway, let Alice know you.</p>
