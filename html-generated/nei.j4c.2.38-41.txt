      <span class="salute">Dear Sterling:—</span>


      <p>I suppose I seem like an ingrate — two or three good letters from you, &amp; a long silence at this end. The excusee is that I've had a deuce of a lot of work. Have been winding up the books for the year, gardening, moving, building, digging, writing — and along with it all I've been sort of run down. Am picking up in fine shape now.</p>
    
      <p>Just the same, Old man, I'm a hell of a good friend of yours, whether I write or not, &amp; I'm proud to be that.</p>
    
      <p>The babies had a riffing time with the beautiful shells of even Sigurd associated them with "Unkie", tho' he did not

<div class="note">Do you know John Galen Howard? He wants to visit me, he says.</div>





know which uncle. Enid remembers you &amp; now &amp; then recalls the fact that she kissed you.</p>

      <p>"Hugh Glass" goes on with a fine steady, tho slow gait. I'm in no hurry, &amp; believe I'm getting there.</p>

      <p>I begin to feel the vague something that I have sometimes called the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> will, pushing me toward the Pacific. Wouldn't be surprised if I should land on a job out there.</p>

      <p>Say, have you <del/>seen B. S. Wagstaff's new book? Hooray! Likewise, Hullabaloo! Also, God save the Queen &amp; together with other expressions of enthusiasm! Rah! Rah! What t' hell, anyway? Vrerech says it is "another Faust". And yet



Goethe worked a half century on his &amp; he had one of the greatest brains a man ever had. Nay, nay, Blanche! Also, another freak says "Eris" is "The poem of the century". Le Galliene says that it is "beauty gathered up into a star" — whatever that means. Is Le Galheine drinking again, &amp; what does he drink? Such a rattle headed composition as that "Eris" is, to be sure! Blanche might be developed to a point when she could do fairly creditable work as a factory hand. But I am optimistic just now, &amp; may be mistaken.</p>
    
      <p>Anyway, Sterling, what in thunder is there for <u>you</u> among so many chasers of their own tails? Silence






for you, &amp; seclusion &amp; work — and wine if you can use it to advantage. Sooner or later you will get a bellyful of crowded places, &amp; I'll be happy when you break away.</p>
    
      <p>How about the dramatic poem &amp; "Lillith"? anything doing? I'm sure it's a big thing that needs you as a medium.</p>
        
        <p>Sometime I hope you &amp; I may be able to take a wild trip together!</p>
      <p>Do you need Socrates?</p>
