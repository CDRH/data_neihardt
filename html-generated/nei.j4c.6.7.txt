      <span class="salute">Dear Sinclair: —</span>

	     <p>"The Brass Check" is terrific. I do hope they won't make you the victim of a frame-up. I'm a bit worried for you. Lord! What courage you have! And what a work you are doing!</p>
	     <p>I can distribute a dozen copies here at once, but I haven't the cash to send in advance. Send me a dozen in cloth, and I'll remit within a week after receipt. I'll probably be able to handle more later. This thing must get to the people.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With all good wishes,</span>

         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. Neihardt
</span>


      <p>Send  bill at once, so that I may know what to charge. — J. N.</p>
