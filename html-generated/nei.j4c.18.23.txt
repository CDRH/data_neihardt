                <p>It has just struck me that Neihardt Hall at Wayne should be mentioned under "Honors". That's a very fine monument!</p>
                
                <p>Also, you might want to say that the  bell I <u>used</u> to ring is now mounted on a stone base on the campus, and that when it was dedicated, my daughter, Hilda, then a student, unveiled the monument and rang the bell. Makes a pretty story, I think!</p>

                <p>Bancroft, some years ago, made a record of all the places where I lived there and recorded it at the county seat, West Point. The same was done at Wayne.</p>
