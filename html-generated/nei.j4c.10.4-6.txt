      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Many thanks for the special delivery - also for the bully letter from you rec'd â„… the judge.</p>

      <p>Finest of success at Omaha. They made me give <u>two</u> complete programs in one evening.</p>

      <p>I'm delighted to know that you are working again on the Book. Best of luck this time! I too believe in it - did before, &amp; was surprised at the publishers, tho', of course, I couldn't know what was in demand.</p>

      <p>Yes, I'd like the other letters. Will go after the bunch with a will + send all back together.</p>

      <p>I have no suggestions as to your Guild speech on me. You'll know what to say. I wish I could sneak around + hear without your being aware of my presence.</p>



      <p>I think you are quite right about Alexander + also in what you say of the World-Herald. It's God damn small business, I think. I've seen + felt practically what you mention.</p>

      <p>I have not the least dread of Alexander under any circumstances. He will not act <u>in my presence</u>, and, furthermore, many are on to him. I admire much in him but fear he's an envious man. I have many faults, but envy is not one of them. I have never envied anyone, being what I must be + doing what I have undertaken to do.</p>

      <p>Alexander has praised me highly on several occasions; but my known friendliness to Scott + Sherman <u>+</u> Avery will make a difference. Well, I'll tell anyone I like Avery. I have felt his warmth + essential bigness, and that's all I need.</p>

      <p>Doctor, I've <u>won now</u>, for I do not count winnings as most do. My Collected Poems is sufficient justification for one little man's life. I can no longer be defeated. If I have potential enemies, they may shoot + be damned. There is a future that will love me a little at least. That's sure.</p>
