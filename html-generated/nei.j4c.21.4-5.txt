                <p>I've been thinking about your proposed work on public speaking in America since the Revolution, and the thought is thrilling. It's a whale of a book — already <u>there</u> for you to realize.

                <p>It was good to see you, but I do regret that Mona could not be with us. There'll be another time.</p>
