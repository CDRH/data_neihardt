                    <span class="salute">Dear Mott:-</span>
                
      <p>Just home from a month's trip. Glad to get your letter. Macmillan's contract for my COLLECTED POEMS was on my desk when I reached home. Evidently they are eager to close.</p>
      <p>Yes indeed, I shall see that you get an advance copy of THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS, if possible. At any rate, you shall have one of the first copies.
</p>
      <p>I congratulate you (and the readers of the Midland) upon your joint-editorship! That's bully! I will subscribe. Put me down now and send bill.
</p>
      <p>I'm in a frightful rush with letters, but this carries every good wish.
</p>

      <p>My wife was glad to be remembered and sends greetings.</p>
