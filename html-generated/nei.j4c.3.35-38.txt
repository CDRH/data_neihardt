      <span class="salute">Dear Friend:—</span>

	     <p>Your visit had the usual good effect. I was doubly a poet yesterday, &amp; finally wrought lines fairly besieged me. I am going to have a wonderful time in describing that superb body of <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>. There is something almost intoxicating about the thought of capturing all those lines about it that are after me yet today. You are always an instrument in time when I see <u>you</u>, &amp; that augments whatever music is in me.</p>

      <p>After you left, I began really to think about Mrs. Sheldon's letter. I couldn't quite see all





around it while you were here. And it has come to seem to me that I ought <u>not</u> to accept the $15 offer for an appearance before the Thursday Lecture Circle. The Woman's Club might be all right; would be so, if the women could take me seriously enough to pay as others have &amp; will pay. You see, Doctor, the fact is that to those women I am a sort of local celebrity trying to get on. But I am decidedly not that. Perhaps it would be better to give the women time to learn something about modern American poetry before I go to them. I dislike <u>patronage</u> based on a poor understanding, as this is likely to be.</p>




	     <p>Don't you think it would be better to save Lincoln for a better opportunity if the Woman's Club doesn't want me enough to pay me?</p>
	     <p>You are my friend — one of my very best friends — and you will not see in this anything even remotely resembling a lack of appreciation for your efforts. You must remember that my home state, until you came, did absolutely nothing for me. London &amp; New York &amp; Chicago &amp; San Francisco <del/> praised me long before Nebraska knew of my existence. They must <u>want</u> me, or I must not go to them.</p>
	     <p>I mentioned Mrs. Borghum of Omaha as the woman who could &amp; would handle a reading in Omaha, — Mrs. August Borghum. I have misplaced her address, but the family is well known  there. I would like to go to Omaha. <del/>
      </p>
	     <p>Isn't it fine weather? I begin to feel a bit like "April Theology".</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours always,</span>
         <br/>John
</span>


      <p>I enclose Mrs. Sheldon's letter, thinking that perhaps I ought not answer it under the circumstances.</p>
      <br/>J.
<p>Did I tell you that the Fortnightly Club of Chicago plans to have me there <del/> during the coming winter?</p>
