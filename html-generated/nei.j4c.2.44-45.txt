      <span class="salute">Dear Old Man:—</span>


      <p>It gave me a thrill to see your handwriting on a package yesterday, and the contents made me happy.</p>

      <p>What could I say about the book that I have not already either written or said about your poetry? I know many of the poems, tho' several of the finest are new to me. "Tidal" is a musical wonder &amp; crammed with the old mystery of poetry.</p>

      <p>I'm devilish proud of you, Sterling — yes, and fond of you.</p>

      <p>One of these times I may write about some of the newer poems in detail.</p>




      <p>How are you? Fairly happy? Fairly happy is enough in this stage of the long game.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I invaded the country of the cottontails to some effect. Never used a shot-gun before — always a rifle; but I find that a shot-gun after a rifle is like prose after poetry — easy enough. However, I fancy a shot-gun won't teach rifle-shooting. Saw a gray wolf's a — going over a branch of slough-grass, but didn't get close enough for the scatteration gun.</p>

      <p>"Hugh Glass" is once more pushing on, after a week or two spent on a short-story. The latter is called "The Red Room Ware." I needed the money, damnit!</p>

      <div class="note">2,100 lines on "Glass". 700 more to do.</div>

         <span class="salute">Always yours,</span>

         <br/>John.
