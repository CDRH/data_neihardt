                <p>I'm mailing you a recording of excerpts from <u>Three Friends</u>. I've lost track of Sanford Gray, who was doing this work. Haven't the slightest notion what happened to him! This recording is of fine quality, but I regret that we did not indicate what was omitted. With a copy of <u>The Song of Three Friends</u> in hand while listening, this fault can be remedied.</p>
                
                <p>
         <u>You are very dear.</u>
      </p>
