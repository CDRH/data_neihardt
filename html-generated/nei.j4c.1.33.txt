      <span class="salute">Dear Davis:â€”</span>


	     <p>I have been intending to tell you how bully I think
the decorations of "Man-Song" are! You ought to congratulate
the artist for me. He got right into the lines.</p>
	     <p>Davis, on July first I start on my three thousand mile
canoe trip down the Missouri. Will use a four horse power
canoe; start at Fort Benton, Mont., and go to St. Louis.
Can't you drop me a line at Fort Benton, wishing me luck?
I'll be there until the tenth.</p>
