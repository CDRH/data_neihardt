      <div class="note">American poet and playwright, publishing over twenty volumes of verse.  Born on Long Island, NY, he was a long-time resident of California, establishing an artistsâ€™ colony in Carmel.  Ambrose Bierce was his literary mentor; a close friend of Jack London, he served as the later encourager of the younger Robinson Jeffers.  A member of the Bohemian Club, he participated in dramatic productions.  His verse is distinguished by its Romantic, mystical, visionary and sensual qualities, including themes of incest and homosexuality; sometimes classified as an American Decadent.   Known to carry a vial of cyanide, he eventually used it to take his own life.</div>
