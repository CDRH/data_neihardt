                <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
                <p>I have just finished my third Sunday page, and I think at least the last two have been pretty good. People seem to think so. At any rate, I have enjoyed the work, and am quite happy. Everyone in the building is more than ordinarily friendly and I get remarkable co-operation from all departments.</p>
                
                <p>We are needing two pages badly, and I think we'll get them. We really need a book section, and it wouldn't surprise me if we'd get that during the year. I have a staff of fifteen reviewers now, and could easily increase this to twenty-five--good, competent reviewers all of them, some considerably more than competent.</p>
                
                <p>I have just heard that the Friends of American Writers Foundation for Literature has given me the award for poetry this year. Gunther's "Inside Europe" and Peattie's "Singing in the Wilderness" received the prose awards. I do not make much of this, but it's pleasing and the money is useful.</p>
                
                <p>I do wish you could visit me here. We'd have a swell time together.</p>
                
                <p>I have planned for no more than one year here, and I came back not because I felt forced to do so, but because I thought it would be good to clean out my mind for the last book in the Epic Cycle.</p>
                
                <p>I have a feeling in my bones that particularly good things will happen this year, just what I cannot say. I feel a good deal<del/> as I have felt when swimming in still water and suddenly coming to a strong current.</p>
                
                <p>I do wish I could see you.</p>
