      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>The October number seems to me a very good thing and I congratulate you again. Yes, I do like the articles on my stuff and am grateful. I wish I knew how to be encouraging in the matter of bringing the magazine to St. Louis. I maintain something of the status of a recluse in this town, much to the bewilderment of the many who have tried and tried and tried to make me mix. <del/> One result is that I know little of the town and have made no powerful connections in a personal way. The other and very desirable result is that what I have to say in my column


exerts a rather surprising influence, and no one ever even ventures to "call me down" though God knows I am not saying the expected thing. I note that a new "Mirror" has just been launched here. It<del/>s first number is fair <del>and</del>, but I have no notion that it can ever justify its name, considering Wm. Marion Reedy's record with the old Mirror<del/>. It is devoted to boosting St. Louis while striving to be a literary mag. I doubt if it has solid backing, and it may die soon. This is an intensely materialistic burg, and I can't feel that the chances for prying anybody loose from his money <del>are very good</del> for a literary project are very good. Perhaps if you could visit here with me you could stir something up.</p>

      <p>This is done rapidly but it <del/> bears love, as you know without being told.</p>
