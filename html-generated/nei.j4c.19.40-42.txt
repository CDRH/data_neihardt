                <span class="salute">Dear Geo. Steele:</span>
                
                <p>I promise to  be good from now on — so don't scold me anymore! The fact is that Mona and I are happy to know that our "honey-haired brat" can be with Mrs. Seymour and you. She loves to be with you, and your several ears must have burned pleasantly while she was visiting with us recently. We only hope that she can find something to do for you. Bless your good hearts!</p>
                
                <p>You must have seen the "Admiral" by now, and a fine dear man he is! Soon he will be coming over to see us and make his report, for he must be "back on the ship" by now.</p>
                    
                    <p>As you've heard, I'm flirting with the idea of finding a job in Chicago. I do greatly appreciate your approaching the Tribune for me, but I fear they cannot use me. Papers are running short-handed in the departments where I could be useful. I've felt them out <del>of</del> over a wide area — and everywhere it is the same. What they all need is young reporters and occasionally desk men. Atho' my vision is good, my eyes will
                        
                        
                        no longer stand steady reading all day. I've read such hills of books.</p>
                   
                    <p>I've wondered if I might not get on a weekly or monthly publication. I've handled a mass of MS, and know how. I'm really <u>good</u>! Some time back, according to Hiddy, there was a call for an editorial worker on a medical magazine, &amp; one with some Greek &amp; Latin would have been especially acceptable. I could have handled that nicely. I could and would handle commercial house-publications. There are business jobs I could handle too, for I spent some years in business offices. I'd rather  <u>not</u> have to write for a living.</p>
                    
                    <p>Macmillans are now pushing ahead with the manufacturing of the one-volume  
                        <u>Cycle of the West</u>, and Latham  <u>does</u> seem to have enthusiasm. I've just written the Introduction, and must now prepare the map of the whole country between the Missouri and the Pacific. Here is where Mona comes in with lettering.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amama is here, and we're happy together as before. She's a good girl when she doesn't
                        
                        
                        cry about the war. When she does, she's naughty and we become very stern with her! But mostly she's a pretty good girl, and we hope to raise her in the way she should go. Christian influence, and all that. A highly moral atmosphere and firm discipline.</p>
                    
                    <p>I haven't written you for ages, but I'm making up for it now. You'll admit this is a lovely letter.</p>

                    <span class="salute">Please give our regards to Mrs. Petri. And here are grateful and affectionate thoughts for you two.</span>
