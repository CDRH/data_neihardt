Mr. John Jay Chapman,
New York City.

<span class="salute">My dear Mr. Chapman:—</span>

      <p>I have found your "Learning and Other Essays" in the latest batch of books sent me by the Times Book Review, and I want to express to you my admiration and gratitude for the work in a more personal way than the nature of an article would allow me to do. I find in it much of the quality that makes Hugo's "William <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Shakespeare​ ">Shakespere</a>
    ​" my constant desk companion. There is <u>space</u> about your book.</p>

      <p>This is just a sincere brotherly word.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
