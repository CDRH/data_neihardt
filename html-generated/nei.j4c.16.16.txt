      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I missed some points in answering your letter yesterday.</p>
                
      <p>Of course I shall be glad to autograph the book for your friend.</p>
                
      <p>I'd love to visit you and lecture there; but I cannot know yet when I may be sent back to the Pine Ridge Reservation to get a book for Macmillans. Expect to hear soon.</p>
                
      <p>I've been reading the Upson Number. Yes, it is enough and beautifully done. Russell and Jones are very real persons. You should feel that you have done a good deed.</p>
                
      <p>Regardless of what he says about my stuff, Coolidge is no fool, believe me. You should cultivate him as a contributor. His explanation of the popular vogue for "Trees" is, I feel sure, correct. Several years ago I gave the same explanation, but I'm sure he is unaware of the fact.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Endless love,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
