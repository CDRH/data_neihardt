                <p>That's a devil of a hard break, and I'm more sorry than I can say! I wish I could be with you while you are laid up. Your note indicates that you are standing it with your accustomed philosophic good sense, which I sometimes envy you. Anyway, here's love, best of Comrades. I suppose you will be able to keep the magazine going by using a stenographer.</p>

                <span class="salute">Always yours,</span>
                    
                    <br/>Jno.
