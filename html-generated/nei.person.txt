      <h3>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES</h3>
      <h3>John G. Neihardt correspondents</h3>
      <p>Neihardt’s professional literary correspondence includes exchange with figures of national and international importance and as such provides direct evidence of his wide-ranging and inclusive intellectual relationships.   In the first few decades after Frederick Jackson Turner declared the American frontier “closed,” Neihardt’s list of correspondents represents another kind of open space ready to be explored — an extensive network of adventurous and diverse minds eager to share knowledge and information across many kinds of educational, political and social boundaries and differences of religion, race, gender, and geographical region.</p>

            <div class="note">Born in Kentucky, author of 36 books and nearly 3,000 poems; known as the Keats of Kentucky for his Romantic evocation of natural world.  Earning an international reputation, Edmund Gosse selected the verse and wrote the introduction to his collection, Kentucky Poems; his work was recognized by Pres. Theodore Roosevelt with an invitation to the White House (1905); his friendships included Kate Chopin, E. A. Robinson, Oliver Wendell Holmes.
    
    In 1913, he published a poem entitled “Waste Land” in Poetry magazine in an issue that also contained an essay by Ezra Pound.  Said to have influenced T. S. Eliot’s 1922 work, “The Waste Land,” (which is often identified as the beginning of modernist poetry), Cawein’s work also drew deeply upon Anglo-European literary allusion and classical mythology.  Unlike Eliot, however, he wrote in traditional verse form.</div>
