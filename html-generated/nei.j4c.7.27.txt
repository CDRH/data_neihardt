      <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:â€”</span>

      <p>Thanks for the good letter and for the manuscript. It would be a good idea to substitute Mrs. Avery's Bookfellow poem for the one I included in the Pack. I can see that you had a bully time on the 14th!</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours always,</span>

         <br/>Jno. N.
