      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
 
      <p>The Saturday Review of Literature says, in concluding its article on my work: "Verily the Old West has found its Homer". That helps. As a matter of fact, though so much has been said for my work, more will be said as the years pass. Things are shaping steadily to releases me from this job, which I like very much in itself, but cannot aford to keep. I have the contract with The Affiliated Lyceums etc. Also, there is a big deal on here that may make me more money than I need. I'll tell you of this later. Am planning to work you in on it, as you would be very much at home in the work and happy.</p>

      <p>Royalties this year were an even thousand. Last year $28 more. Pretty good for any poet, and especially good for one who has not made advantageous contracts and has no Eastern clique influences. The school edition of Glass and the friends sold 2600. That's good too, considering that Macmillans have done nothing to pushes the sales. We need you on the road with them. The big deal I mentioned above would use you only in the summer.</p>

      <p>The Christian Science Monitor calls my Lindbergh poem "magnificent". The thing goes around. I heard from the 
    
    
    Prime Minister of Newfoundland about it the other day, and the head of the Hawaian school system wrote enthusiastically.</p>
      <p>
         <del/>
      </p>

      <p>I'm spending $700 on my Branson home, and will make it all new before I quit. It is a dear, dear country to live in, and we all love it. I shall keep that for a place to fly to. May even live there five months in the year after<del/> the kids through school here. I mean Sig and Enid.</p>

      <p>This will find you in the East.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Endless love, dearest comrade in the world!</span>

         <br/>Jno
</span>
      <p>You can make an interesting and enduring book out of your new version of Man and Poet. I feel sure of this. Macmillans will take it, too.</p>
