      <span class="salute">Dear Sterling:-</span>


      <p>Your good letter reached me this morning, &amp; I must say a few things to you while I'm digesting a lunch (!) of baked beans.</p>

      <p>The first thing in line is to insist that you stop &amp; give us a chance at you when you pass through as Omaha is in your route, &amp; Bancroft is only $1.46 more &amp; 73 miles. You can do it nicely! I am poor, as you know, but always have enough to eat, &amp; we can give the front of the house to sleep in, providing you can sleep on a couch &amp; if you can't you are not the Scout I take you to be. Eh? What? Of course you can stop off!</p>

      <p>So when are you due?</p>





      <p>The second thing: My friend, Kreider, a composer, is in Calif. now &amp; will go East soon. He admires your stuff &amp; wants to call on you if he may. If this is agreeable, won't you drop him a line <u>at once</u>? His address is:


Noble W. Kreider,
762 St. John's Ave.,
Pasadena

</p>

      <p>I haven't mentioned the selection of lyrics simply because I have a better plan. That's all. I understand you perfectly.</p>

      <p>As for Greek &amp; Latin â€” I go in more for the former, tho' I am only a tyro. Nevertheless, I shall continue until I dir. The way is the goal, anyway. I love the stuff. Larin is too foursquare <span class="unclear ">[somehow?]</span>.



yet I once ate Latin as a regular diet. Never was an expert, but was pretty fair at it. Greek seems an essential to happiness almost. Yes, you dear chap, you did send the sonnet! And a riffing thing it is!</p>

      <p>Glad you are feeling better.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours always,</span>
         <br/>Jno.

      <p>Have reached line 900 in Hugh Glass. It moves slowly, but it is <u>constructed</u>, I think. The problem is very different from that of a lyric. You once asked why I used rhyme instead of blank verse? Because one may use the <u>
            <span class="unclear ">[method?]</span>
         </u>





of blank verses in rhyme, and the latter acts as a necessary limitation. Rhyme makes for <u>economy</u> &amp; speed &amp; gives a sort of "come on" to a tale. I'm using it in "Hugh Glass", but with the tricks of blank verse always working. Catch me?</p>
