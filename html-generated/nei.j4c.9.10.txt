      <span class="salute">Dear Seymours:-</span>
  

      <p>I am scheduled to arrive in Chicago, via Burlington, at 3:59 P.M., October 31st. Must leave next morning. Of course I want to see you; but I shall be nearly worn out, as I shall have had eight engagements in ten days with constant travelling. Expect to be very dull. These trips do terrible things to me.

      <p> I wouldn't want to see you at all under the circumstances if I did not feel something homey about you. This is my best compliment, and a sincere one. Mr. Long writes that you might want to have some Bookfellows in. I'd like that too, if it could be an off-hand affair.

 Please mail a copy of the ADDRESS to each of the following:<br/>

Mrs. Carl Brown, Simpson College, Indianola, Ia.<br/>

Miss Morrison, Tabot College, Tabor, Iowa.<br/>

Those with my compliments. I'll pay.</p>
