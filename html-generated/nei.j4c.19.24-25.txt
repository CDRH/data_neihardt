                <p>I'm really ashamed that I haven't written you for so long a time; but you may be sure that all my thoughts of you  — and there have been many — were affectionate and grateful ones. This has been rather a distracting sort of winter for me, as for most people, altho' I have no complaints to make. On the contrary, I am deeply grateful for so very much.</p>
                
                <p>I'm afraid the St. Louis agency did not realize conditions — both of mind and purse — among people generally. Around defense centers, there is a false sense of prosperity that misleads. If we had gone ahead with our smaller ideas, there might have been more or less of a Nebraska trip, though I don't feel sure. As it is, I <u>may</u> go to several places, and I may not. It doesn't really matter in the least. My feeling for you two <u>does</u> matter, and it is much auged.</p>
                
                <p>I've just returned from another visit (my third)<del/> at Kemper Military School. <div class="note">(over)</div>

                <p>I do hope things are going reasonably well for you. Are you, Elmer, likely to get into some good defense job? I've been trying through Lowell Mellet since a year ago last December. Mellet is one of the "upstairs cabinet", you know. He seems to want to use me; but there must be a ludicrous state of confusion in Washington.</p>
                
                <p>Golly! What a world they've made of it!</p>
                
                <p>Anyway, there <u>are</u> values that matter.</p>
