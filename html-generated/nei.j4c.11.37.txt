      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span> 
        <p>Your most welcome letter reached me just after I had mailed one to you today. No, I'm not
          sick; but I'm tearing my damned shirt. Have just now finished galley 113 of <u>Collected Poems</u>, leaving over 50 more to read.</p>

        <p>It will be great news when I hear that you've completed the book. How bully to go again
          to Washington! And after that job is finished, you'll do another good one - <u>Man and Poet</u>.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you still find the page interesting. Things look promising for the syndicate.
          I'll report later on that.</p>
        <span class="closer"> 
         <span class="salute">Endless love,</span> 
         <br/>Jno. </span>
