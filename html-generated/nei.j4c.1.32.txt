      <span class="salute">Dear Davis:-</span>


	     <p>Thanks for the permission to republish the Munsey
poems. Some copies of the Bundle will be on the market before
Christmas and about the first of the year the publishers mean 
to boom it. They think they have a piece of literature. I think
it is quite unusual for a big publishing house to monkey with
a young man's poetry â€” isn't? Well, I get considerable satisfaction
out of the fact that they see something in it. This is really a 
small triumph for you, since you championed the Bundle before
any other. For that reason you shall have one of the few copies
that are to be bound in crimson leather with gilt title!</p>
	     <p>It was good of you to express so much faith in me to
the man from Washington with regard to the History of the North
American Indian. But I am afraid you flatter me a wee bit.</p>
	     <p>Could you send me a copy of the All-Story which contains
my story "The Face in the Balcony"? I have no copy of it, and would
like one.</p>
	     <p>One of these days I may be able to send you something
in the line of a story for Munsey's. When I have one that seems
at all suitable to your needs, you may be sure I shall think of
you first.</p>
	     <p>I go to Chicago next Tuesday to arrange with Lieblers for
that play. If Waters vindicates himself here, it will be another
small triumph for you, will it not?</p>
