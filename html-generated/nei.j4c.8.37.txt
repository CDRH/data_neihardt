      <span class="salute">My dear Mrs. Brockway:_</span>
 
      <p>Many thanks for the clippings from Aberdeen and Mount Vernon. I need to see such things, for I never seem to know just how an audience feels about what I have to offer. Often while I am before an audience, I waken from a sort of sleep and feel panic-stricken, wondering if I am boring them horribly. And this, in spite of the fact that I have no fear whatever of a crowd and don't understand stage fright. I knew the crowd at Cornell liked my stuff, because it remained to tell me. But I didn't know a thing about Aberdeen. I had a feeling that perhaps I hadn't quite gotten across.</p>

      <p>You may be sure that I know of your loyalty to the scheme to which I am devoting my life; and you may be sure that I deeply appreciate your help.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">With every kind thought,</span>

         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt

      <p>I've sent the clippings to Mr. Long of Omaha, who is managing me in the West. He will return them to you.</p>
