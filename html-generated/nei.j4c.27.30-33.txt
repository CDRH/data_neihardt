                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                <p>It has come to seem like a long time between times! I had set today as about the right day for a letter from 
                    you! It didn't arrive, so I'm writing you! We don't "owe" letters to each other, and I don't know why I should wait to speak to you, especially since I think of you so often.</p>
                
                <p>We've been having almost all of our winter within the past 10 days — 15 inches of snow in that time, and some low temperatures. The weather has intensified my feeling that you are
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    very far away — <u>farther than usual</u>. (I'm not being sentimental, you must know; that would be too silly. You are the real friend of what I've done and tried to do, <u>and of me</u>, such as I am. So I <u>do miss you</u>).</p>
                
                <p>I've thought of what I wrote you about existentialism. I was thinking only of the brand advocated by Sartre. There are conflicting versions of the philosophy; but Sartre's version, along with some others, definitely belongs to the anarchic mood of our time, as discussed in so many of my P-D articles.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    It's surprising how that thesis, which I elaborated from 1912 to 1931 or 2, <u>does explain</u> our <u>present time</u>!! Really, Lucile, that is the only thesis that <u>does seem</u> to explain the cultural mood of our day.</p>
                
                <p>My Critical Essay class is a <del/> source of pleasure to me. We are gradually upsetting some glittering certainties without being dogmatic; <u>And</u> we are beginning to feel that it is a pleasure to spot our prejudices — since there can be no advantage in
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    getting the wrong answer to any question. We had a lovely session yesterday. A very bright young man discussed Sir Oliver Lodge's "Phantom Walls". (There are a lot of good minds knocking around the campus!)</p>
                
                <p>I've just heard by 'phone from the interior decorator who is making Skyrim beautiful inside. He's <del/>rather expensive, but he gets results. I'll love to see the place as Mona would love to have it. Why?? Well, I'll love to see it that way!</p>

                    <p>I'm at Hiddy's today, alone except for Yo-Yo, who mostly sleeps. But now &amp; then she confronts me in The Big Silence of the house with a woofed question: "Gaki, what are we doing?" I don't know, so I just pet her and tell her I love her. (Isn't that one of the really good answers to many questions?)</p>
                
                <p>It will be bully to be with you next summer and to hear you read to me, because my eyes want to shirk. We'll get some important work done that way; and there <u>is</u> much to do. You know, Mrs. Bower Aly, Lucile,
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    old Doc Aly ("the pretty one"), you are extremely important in the Pattern that somehow has caught us up together. When I'm through in this world, the whole business will be in your hands. That is one reason I like you.</p>
                
                <p>Also, I like Old Man Stewart, Bower, Gramby, and that precious little skinful of goodness, Perky.</p>

                <p>I hope Bower's eye is well by now. Two months ago I had a perfectly lovely infection in my right eye; but it healed rapidly.</p>
