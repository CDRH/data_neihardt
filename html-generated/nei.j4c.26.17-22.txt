                <p>Three nights ago I saw you in a dream and you seemed to be sick. Your face <u>had</u> a grayish look as though you were very weary, and you were dark about the eyes. I'm afraid now that you really are sick, so I'm writing to say I'm thinking about you. Still, I'm hoping that the dream was not "veridical", and that you are only very busy.</p>
                
                <p>I'm  judging a poetry
                
                
                
                
                contest for the Poetry Society of Texas, and the stuff must be returned today. I've been their judge several times before, and always the poetry offered was better than I expected. Some was very fine. But this time I'm judging for only 
                <u>one</u> of <u>various</u> prizes, and I'm sure I have not the best offerings of the contest. My poetry class does far better stuff on the average. (I have two boys who <u>can</u> write poetry; with faults, of course!) There's only one really authentic thing in the Texas stuff. It's short, and it is <del>

                <p>Oh, Lucile, don't be sick!</p>
                
                <p>I've thought of our Bancroft trip a lot. You remember I drew your attention to the old Post Office, don't you? 
                <u>That</u> used to be, and was for years, the most important place in my life. I lived <del/> on the mail, and I <del>
            <span class="unclear ">was[?]</span>
         </del> was always there, ahead of time,
                
                
                
                
                waiting for the mail to be distributed. My god! The heartaches I had in that building! <u>Waiting, waiting â€” and</u> then disappointment! <u>And</u> there were times of joyful triumph too. Generally, after the two Wubs could walk, I had them with me, regardless of the weather. <del>

                <p>O I wish we could dream back the old days in Bancroft &amp; Wayne together!! There is <u>so</u> much to <del/> remember.</p>
               
                <p>Please don't be <u>very</u> sick, Lucile!</p>

                <p>John Jay Chapman, essayist, dramatist, literary and social critic (1862-1933), was an important and controversial figure in his day. He was one of the few to see that young, sprawling, ambitious America in its tremendous effort to get ahead was forgetting how to think, how to believe, and how to be honest. But during the critical years of America's ascendancy to wold power, no one was ready to listen to Chapman. Attacking, ridiculing, and apolgizing for his contemporaries, he was often driven to eccentric frenzies bu the mental torpor he found around him. His violences, which often bordered on insanity, drove away many who might have listened to him. Nevertheless, Chapman played an important role in the development of modern America. He stood for truth, thought, and morality in politics, education, religion, and literature. And the whole fascinating story of this strange but dedicated man is unfolded by Dr. Hovey who has made a detailed study of Chapman's unpublished letters and manuscripts to prepare this book. $6.50</p>
