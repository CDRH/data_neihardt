      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I couldn't get the MS off until today, which is pretty late. But I note by yours just received that you are going ahead and that what you are doing even be substituted for the Notes I am returning to you. Bully! But I think you should go over the MS I am sending, being careful to incorporate <del/> anything that you may lack in the second version. There are some corrections as to fact.</p>

      <p>I was troubled yesterday when I wrote you, but now I know you will make an excellent job of the Notes. We are in high company when we enter the Modern Readers' Series - the 
    
    
    highest there is, and too much attention can not be given to the Notes. The book is going to live on and on. Also, Ashley Thorndike of Columbia is general editor of the series. I would be on you if I knew your whole mind was on the job - every time. I feel that it <em class="hi">is</em> all on the job now.</p>

      <p>Cut out any explanations that, upon second thought, seem obvious, that is, obvious to the sort of people we must reach. Enid will copy what you send back.</p>

      <p>And be sure to send me a bill for your time. That is the rest thing to do. <div class="note">Make it enough to cover.</div>
      </p>
