      <div class="note">American lyric poet, first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for poetry (in 1918, when it was known as the Columbia University Poetry Society Prize).  Born in St. Louis, MO, she frequently traveled to Chicago where she became associated with the Chicago Renaissance and the literary circle forming around Poetry magazine.  Best known for her use of traditional poetic form when others were experimenting with free verse, it was there that she met the poet, Vachal Lindsey who fell in love with her.  Since he could not support her, however, she wed Ernst Filsinger, later divorcing him. She then renewed her friendship with Lindsey (by this time married with a family).  Two years after his suicide, she took her own life as well.</div>
