      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Chapman:—</span>


      <p>The books for which I asked came yesterday, and I am very grateful to you for your generous response to my letter. So far I have merely dipped into "Causes and Consequences", and I have felt in it the same sure-headedness, the same grasp of facts and the same fine vision that stirred me in reading "Learning and Other Essays". I shall have a truly delightful time in preparing that article!</p>

      <p>You were very kind to ask me to stay at your home when I go East again; and when it is possible I shall certainly do so.</p>

      <p>You mention having sent for some of my books. If "The Stranger at the Gate" was not in your order, I should like to send a copy — or any other that you think might interest you.</p>
    
      <p>With all good thoughts,</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
