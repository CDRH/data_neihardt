      <span class="dateline">Bancroft, Nebraska, November 9th, '06.</span>

      <span class="salute">My dear Davis:—</span>


      <p>I have your bully letter with reference to the 
Spectrum story and the poem which was written to that Prince,
Streamer. As to the poem, if Mr. Streamer is willing that it
be published — let 'er go! Could you somehow tack his name to
it? And (as a minor consideration) I need the money! My feeling
for Streamer is such that the poem in question is sacred to me,
but if he has given his permission, I'd be glad to let you use
it. You are right, the man is a bully good fellow. O I'm
finding a lot of good fellows, and you are certainly in the list.</p>
	     <p>
         <u>Although</u> —</p>
	     <p>You <u>do</u> throw wicked brick-bats my way now and then!
There's the "Mignon" letter. Just today I wrote you a reply
to that letter, and to show you that I keep nothing back from
a friend, I shall mail it with this. If I thought you were
a pin-headed person, I should hold the letter back. But
I send it. I want you to see why I don't believe what you said
about my dear wanton little girl, Mignon. File the letter
away among the archives of friendship, and let's not go at
each other with axes any more. You thrust and draw blood —
I parry — is not honor satisfied? Put up the foils!</p>
	     <p>As to the "Spectrum", I think it one of my best bits of
writing, but can readily see why you don't use it. And I must
add that your cleverness is not wasted on me. I enjoy your thrusts.
That's the kind of a fellow I am.</p>
	     <p>You may be sure that I shall give you the opportunity to
show me these things that Streamer never saw, when I get back
there — which will doubtless be this winter. I'll go anywhere
with you but to a Baptist church.</p>
	     <p>I am very glad that you met Streamer; it's good to know
him. I shall make a similar statement to Streamer.</p>
	     <p>Hope you can meet Louis Ledoux one of these times. He is one
of my bully good friends. Do what you can for his Garden of Youth.</p>
      <span class="closer">
