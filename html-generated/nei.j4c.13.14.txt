      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Have just received the April issue, and am looking forward to a bully time with it. I have a really valuable idea to offer, and I am offering it in a hurry between jobs. Here it is.</p>

      <p>Louis J. Alber, who is arranging a tour for me for the coming season, would doubtless be glad for a chance to get a goodly number of copies of this issue to distribute in connection with his booking activities. As you may know, his is about the largest organization of its kind in America - The Affiliated Lyceum and Chataqua something or other - I forgot the exact lingo. Anyway, he has has agents all over the U.S. and Canada. Now why wouldn't it be a very good idea to write him, sending a copy of the magazine and asking if he could use a hundred or so? I think he could. Address him as follows:

Louis J. Alber,

2443 Prospect Ave.,

Cleveland, Ohio.

      <p>More later. Am jumping around.</p>
