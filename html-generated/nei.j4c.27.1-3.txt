                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
                
                <p>Well, I'm back â€” and with some more happy memories! It was a perfect trip and visit, except for Bower's absence; and I saw <u>him just long</u> enough in Portland to feel his warmth of spirit.</p>
                
                <p>My plane was a half hour late at K. C., so I missed the early bus by a few minutes, arriving in Columbia at
                
                
                
                
                12:30 midnight. The family was taking in a late show, so I took a taxi. I had wired from K. C. but the message has not yet reached here!</p>
                
                <p>Albert's father died today, and Albert has gone to St. Louis. The father and mother were here for a visit several weeks ago.</p>
                
                <p>You were so good to this old man, Lucile, and so were Gramby and Stewart. Bless you!
                
                
                    
                
                
                It was a real pleasure to see that beautiful, that perfectly lovely house, and I am so glad you dear people have it. 
                <u>You belong in it</u>.</p>
                
                <p>I called Mrs. McCurdy, and we had a rather long and happy talk about you and Bower and the new house. We even talked a bit about Perky, the sweet, fuzzy <del/> darling!
                    
                    
                    Yo-Yo was joyous when we met. <del/> She heard me from the basement and insisted on coming up at once. I wish I could tell her about Perky!</p>
                
                <p>I keep seeing all the beauty out there, and I keep feeling all the goodness too.</p>
