                <p>This is for both of you, but Bower may not be back yet. I enclose a witnessed record of an experience. Perhaps you may want to copy it and return the original to me. Also, I enclose some letters that should be useful. The one from Kotoff (who left the University over 8 years ago) is typical and may be used in you dissertation. Others will be useful in some way, I'm sure.</p>
                
                <p>You know, of course, that my relation to Mona was no matter
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    of weak dependence — <u>leaning</u>. Our relation was (and is) that of an untroubled comradeship with perfect understanding and trust. She <del/> often said, as a result of certain crises, that 'You always rise to an emergency, Daddy'. And I did. So did she!! I could bet on her. I'm in no belly-aching mood. It's my body, more than myself that is hard hit. I've been trying to make my solar plexus &amp; stomach do their old jobs. <del/>They are beginning to obey a little better. 
                    
                   
                    
                    
                    All the while, I remember that the whole human race is troubled, and I have no right (or desire) to overstress my hurt. I'm writing you intimately because <u>you</u> are my link with the worldly future, and any good that has come through me may go on, at least awhile, through you.</p>

                <p>There have been so many letters — a sworn storm of them. I can't answer all. What I send (a few) apply to your purpose now.</p>
