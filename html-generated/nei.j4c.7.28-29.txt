      <span class="salute">Dear Sterling:—</span>


      <p>A bully long letter from you, which I shall answer soon. Just now I have time only to say that I'm sending a chap to you and that you needn't spend much time on him. He's a hero-worshipper &amp; wants a look at you. Don't scare him, and don't regard him as a minister <span class="unclear ">[plenipotentiary?]</span> (!) from me — that is, as to my views of things. I like him, however. Be a nice purring lion — give him a fine memory, Old Scout!</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Always yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>


      <p>Got a hell of a sore finger &amp; can scarcely scribble. (Bully swimming + fishin' here — love of a place!)</p>
      <p>Kindest regards to Mrs. T. She does me too much honor.</p>
