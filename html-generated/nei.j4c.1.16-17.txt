      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Davis:â€”</span>

	     <p>I have received your very kind letter of the 6th.
I wish I <u>could</u> sit under a pine tree with you as you suggest, and
chortle verses, interspersing them with reminiscence. But that
can not be just yet, tho' I have no doubt at all that one day
I shall have the privilege of knowing you more intimately,
when I will not fail to make you feel how grateful I am for
your friendship.</p>
	     <p>As to the questions you asked, will say: I am not married,
and hope that I have no children! (Somebody ought to throw a brick
at me for that!) For the past year I have been doing stunts
with my pencil, and managed to live pretty well on that. I am
all the time grinding away at what is the work of my life.
Little by little I can see that things are taking form. I have
considerable finished work up my sleeve, which I shall throw at
the unoffending world when the time comes. It looks like it
might be coming at a comfortable little canter.
I have not thought carefully about leaving Nebraska, but of course
if I could see a better way, I should go that way. I'm rather
afraid of a city, however. I was born near one and lived most
of my life in one. Perhaps I might have more sense the next time.
You understand.</p>
	     <p>I shall surely have my friend call on you when he goes back.
He will arrive here about August first and will probably be back

in your town soon after you return from your Maine trip.</p>
	     <p>I trust that you will thoroughly enjoy your outing,
and I shall pray that you have good fisherman's luck!
However, I am not certain that I stand well with the Old Man
who gathers in the prayers.</p>
