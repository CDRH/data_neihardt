   </h3>
   <p>
      <div class="note">Raised on a farm in upstate New York, he graduated from Cornell with a degree in botany and attended graduate school at Butler University and the University of Indiana School of Medicine. Emulating Louis Agassiz, he studied ichthyology and taught natural history, writing over half a dozen scientific texts on fish and discovering over two thousand species, becoming one of the foremost American experts on fish.   He joined the faculty of the University of Indiana in natural history in 1879 and was named president in 1885 (the nation’s youngest at the time).  In 1891, upon the recommendation of Andrew White, then President of Cornell, he became first President of the newly established Stanford University.
    
    In addition to his work in education and administration, he was a peace activist who opposed war (for evolutionary reasons to preserve the genetic diversity) and served as president of the World Peace Foundation and World Peace Conference.  He testified as an expert witness for the defense in the Scopes Trial and worked with the ACLU to raise funds for Scopes’ defense.  He was also a member of the Bohemian Club and served as a Director of the Sierra Club.  He was a trustee of the Human Betterment Foundation, an organization that distributed information about eugenics, especially legislation regarding forced sterilization (he did not support the radical implications of eugenics).</div>
