      <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Davis:</span>


      <span class="lg">
         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">And shall I grow as fat as you, my friend in old New York?</span>
            <span class="l">Eat capon? Ever pull with pride the plutocratic cork?</span>
            <span class="l">My ship rides in the offing with a windless idle sail;</span>
            <span class="l">I have not hit the pace that counts; I have not hit the nail.</span>
            <span class="l">Yet, tho' I'm lean, and tho' you eat and drink the stuff that fats,</span>
            <span class="l">God bless you with your Burgundy — I stick to Wiener-Blatz!</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">Out here amid the wind-blown corn we eat the festive swine;</span>
            <span class="l">We eat him with the hair on, and we don't know much of wine.</span>
            <span class="l">The capon that shall fatten me has not yet felt the knife;</span>
            <span class="l">He hasn't made his crow before the footlights of this life.</span>
            <span class="l">He's still a mystic riddle in an egg as yet unlaid,</span>
            <span class="l">And his mother hasn't even cackled yet; I am afraid!</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">My Burgundy — if ever I should drink the stuff by chance—</span>
            <span class="l">Is still a latent dampness in the sunny slopes of France,</span>
            <span class="l">A thrill among the vineyard roots, a dream of sun and dew!</span>
            <span class="l">But I am glad to hear, my friend, it is not so with you.</span>
            <span class="l">For tho' I'm forced to thinner founts than those that cheer and fat you,</span>
            <span class="l">God send you wine!</span>
            <span class="l">PROST!</span>
            <span class="l">O'er a stein, kind friend, I'm lookin' at you!</span>
         </span>
      </span>

      <span class="closer">
 					   <span class="salute">Sincerely,</span>
					    <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt</span>

      <p>P. S. I will bother you with a story or two soon. I am working on a book manuscript which interests me quite a good deal.—</p>
