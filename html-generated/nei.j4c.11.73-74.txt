      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Would you care to write to the Sunday Editor of the Post-Dispatch, offering to <del/>write a feature article on my COLLECTED POEMS? I rather think you might get across, and you'd be paid. It would be an opportunity to sum up my work and its significance. You would state that you are the editor of the school editions of my epics and the author of a book on me and my work. Frank Mott says he has been commisioned by the N. Y. Herald-Tribune to do an article on my Collected Poems.</p>

      <p>I'm looking forward most eagerly to your coming.</p>

         <span class="salute">With love always, good Comrade,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
</span>
      <p>Don't say anything, about my having suggested this, but, of course, you wouldn't point out that <span class="unclear ">[my?]</span> cycle is of special significance to St. Louis &amp; territory &amp; show why briefly.</p>
