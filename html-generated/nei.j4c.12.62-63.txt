      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I'm rushing out a lot of wail, but I want to add to my letter of yesterday as follows: I am absolutely sympathetic with the rabble in the matter of economic + human rights, + if a row should ever come, I shall not on the side of the machine guns. But I am absolutely opposed to the rabble when it monkeys with values it can not understand.</p>

      <p>I feel sure you will 

    
    be with me on this. Vulgar minds can not make my esthetic + ethical values for me. And remember what I said about the "cleavage".</p>
