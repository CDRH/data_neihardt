                <span class="salute">Dear Slade and Nita:</span>
                
                <p>Many thanks for the good letter! I'm glad to know, Slade, that Potter asked to see the MS. At any rate, he will <u>read</u> it, or his wife will. (I met her and had a good talk with her). Of course the decision depends wholly on what may seem to be the outlook for sales; but I <u>do</u> have hope, and I'm so eager to hear more from Potter.</p>
                
                <p>I still feel that the portion on
                   
                   
                    
                    
                    
                    painting might be shortened or the portions on literature and music lengthened.</p>
                
                <p>I think and think of you there, and it is not difficult to fancy myself there with you. Maybe sometime you will meet my phantasm coming down the stairs!! Such things have happened, you know. You two are very dear.</p> 
               
                <p>We have a new horse. It's a Walking Horse stallion, 6 years old. He is <u>big</u> â€” 16 hands high, and he is
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    a dappled gray with long white mane and tail. The big beautiful lubber is as sweet-natured as a kitten, and he knows some tricks! For instance, at word of command he kneels, and then rolls over! I think I'll do some riding now, for his gait is <del/> very easy.</p> 
               
                <p>Nita, you'll remember I mentioned the book on bread by Dr. Graham. The date <em class="hi">is</em> 1837, which is rather surprising. The <del/> title is "Treatise on Bread
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    and Bread Making by Sylvester Graham". The book looks <u>fresh</u> inside, and <del/> doesn't seem <del>127</del> 123 years old. I note that the present generation <del/> does not know the expression "graham <del>
