                <p>You're back again and so am I. This is just to say hello and how good it was to be with you<del/> for a few minutes in Portland. You and I <u>are</u> drawn together by Fate, and yet we seem to slip past one another!! One of these times perhaps we'll have a real comradely session — maybe over a tall stein of Olympia. I hope so.</p>
                
                <p>My visit was for good me. I'm really a bit lonely, I can tell you, 

<div class="note">(over)</div> 
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    and it was good to be in your home for a few days. Everyone was so good to me — including precious Perky! I <em class="hi">have</em> wondered, since my return, if I was not an intruder, but it was good to be with Charles and Minna, Robin and Barbara. They are dear people. And old Casey! What a boy!</p>
                
                    <p>It was good of you to let me share in getting Perky for old man Stewart! I love that young man, and now I love his doggie too.</p>
                
                <p>Good liking this old man at least a little!</p>
