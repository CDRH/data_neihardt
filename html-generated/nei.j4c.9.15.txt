   <p>Macmillans have this to say about THE WARS:
</p>
   <p>"May I tell you how very much we admire your book. It seems to our readers, and to all of our people here who have looked at it, a thoroughly superb pieces of work, thrilling as narrative and profoundly impressive in the effect that it leaves. Crazy Horse and others stand out as great tragic figures. I thought you should know something of our own reaction to your really wonderful work".
</p>
   <p>Isn't that pretty good for a hard-boiled publishing house? The manuscript is now in charge of the art dep't., where plans are being made for the de luxe deluxe edition.
</p>
   <p>MOTION PICTURE FOR AUGUST, I'm told, had my picture and an announcement of the filming of the FRIENDS. I haven't seen it.
</p>
   <p>Lots of love for all of you.
