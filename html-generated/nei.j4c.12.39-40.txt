      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>Bully to hear from you. I told you in my last of Hodge's Handbook of American Indians. That will give you information on individuals and their careers.</p>

      <p>The "white chief" who went down "feathered like a goose" was undoubtedly Fetterman himself, + you may so state.</p>

      <p>Am feeling fairly well again.</p>

      <p>Have had our house in Branson made <u>new</u>. Its a dandy. The men have worked 4 weeks on it + it is nearly finished.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Endless love</span>

         <br/>Jno.
