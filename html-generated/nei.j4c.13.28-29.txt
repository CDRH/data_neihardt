      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I hope that by this time Mrs. House is feeling herself again, and you may be sure that we were all genuinely sorry to hear of her sickness. Give her kindest thoughts from all of us here.</p>

      <p>How are things going with you? Don't you feel an uplift when you think of your quarterly? I should think you would. It is fine for you to have that job on your hands by way of feeding the best in you. And you are certainly making a go of it so far as merit is concerned.</p>

      <p>No doubt you thought of my investments when the Market had its little bust a couple weeks ago. I thought of writing you not to worry, but many things drive me, and I have a deuce of a time writing to my mother. In the evenings I usually flop. I carried 430 shares through the break without a margin call, and am in excellent position to make a killing early in February. Am away ahead of the game now. Did you notice what Pennsylvania is doing?</p>

      <p>I have a very strong hunch that I may be drawn away from here. Can't explain it, but February seems the critical time. <u>Nothing</u> has happened here to make me feel so.

I sent the manuscript of STRAWS IN THE WIND to Macmillans last Friday, and the book should appear in the spring. Surely it is worth publishing. I was a bit surprised at the stuff when I set about editing it.</p>

      <p>Write me something nice. Tell me you care for me sincerely as in the blessed years before we were so widely separated geographically. <u>My heart is warm for you.</u>
      </p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Always with love,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
