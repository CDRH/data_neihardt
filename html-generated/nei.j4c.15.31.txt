                <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
                <p>I see that I have you completely mystified, and no wonder! What you said of Mrs. Rust pleased me, naturally; and certainly I was not referring to her. It was about a general <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="attitude​ ">altitude</a>
    ​ toward women that I, in common<del/> with numerous fine women, without a doubt, regard as overdone, especially in our day of excessive woman flattery when women are certainly far less respected than formerly. The question raised was a general one suitable for discussion only in leisure; and the abrupt statement of it I made in the letter that was not mailed seemed to me unfortunate. We'll talk out this and much more when we meet, bless you! And when is that? I needn't assure you that I hold a high opinion of women! That would be asinine, surely! <del>a</del>A high opinion of the earth and the source of life!! But this is a foolish age and it doesn't know the meaning and value of women nor the truth about their abilities. So much lay behind my raising of the question that could not be obvious, and I feared to seem unfair.</p>
                
                <p>As for knowing more, hasn't it occurred to you that about 90% of what is to be "known" now "ain't so" anyway? You should worry. This is the <del>a</del>Age of the Great Folly, in everything from economics up. I'm rather peaceful in mind and quite reasonably happy. The important thing is not to see too often and too vividly the vision of what is preparing everywhere. Golly! How clear it is -- and "nobody home" anywhere!</p>
                
                <p>I know the people at the banquet liked your speech about my stuff, and your quotations. When you do that sort of thing, there's an outside something that comes through you with power. <u>You</u> feel it and so do the people. The glow and uplift are theirs too.</p>
               
                <p>Well, anyway, try to stay in this world as long as I do; and I'll try to stay as long as you do.</p>
               
                <p>Kindest thoughts <del>fro</del>for Mrs. House. It is perfectly bully to think of Mary's good fortune and happiness! I genuinely rejoice.</p>
                <span class="closer">
                <span class="salute">With love always,</span>
                
                <br/>Jno.
                </span>
                
                <p>Why change your plans about Mrs. Rust?</p>
