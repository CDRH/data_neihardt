      <span class="salute">Dear Sterling:—</span>

      <p>I appreciate that letter of yours written when you were far from happy. I can imagine the situation. But don't worry, old man. Everything is grist for the mills of the <del>gods</del> gods. I feel for both of you, instinctively, marriage can be hell, and separation is a brutal sort of spiritual surgery. There's no solution for such problems, it seems. It's too bad we can't fit into each other better. Men + women never really get acquainted. Strange antagonism made the more terrible with what we call affection. Women are a queer breed; men are a queer breed — and






poets, I fancy, are queerer still. Don't stew, old man.</p>

      <p>Thanks for the poem — a curious, moody thing, and beautiful, of course.</p>

      <p>I'll write <span class="unclear ">[Lindsay?]</span> on the 10th, as you suggest. Very glad for the chance to know him.</p>
    
      <p>When you go on that world — <span class="unclear ">[though?]</span>, don't forget me. Come this way, if possible.</p>

      <p>I want to make a confession &amp; ask a favor. The confession: I gave away my copy of that terrific sonnet, "The Theriot of Satan". A friend, to whom I was deeply indebted, asked for it. A copy wouldn't do. The favor: won't you write me out another — sign it?</p>





      <p>When I get farther along with the "Song of Hugh Glass" I'll give you a copy if you want it. Have 500 lines now — and I believe I'm succeeding. There will be about 1500, and yet the thing is closely wrought. It's a big story, worth elaborating. I'm doing the thing simply &amp; it flows.</p>
    
      <p>Did you know Cawein gave Miss <span class="unclear ">[Moural?]</span> &amp; her fat donkey a gentle drubbing? He did. She sent me the letter last Spring!</p>
    
      <p>Say, The Boston Poetry journal ought to live, because it stands for the real thing as much it can. <span class="unclear ">[Braithwaite?]</span> tells me he's having hard sledding with it — at least he suggests as much.</p>
    
      <p>So long for the moment. Luck to you! Big Brother!</p>
