      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
      <p>Well I should say so! You bet I'll find the time to go over your book with you, and happy I'll be to do it! I've been counting on your coming to the meeting of the socialogical boys in St Louis. Do feel that you can't afford to miss that event! Make it a professional duty! Rationalize like hell by way of explaining the necessity, and after you get here we'll be glad together.</p>

      <p>Things go well at the office + I'm beginning to see my vision clear. It will be column and not a page - a daily column on the holy editorial page of one of the great papers of the world, and I'll talk to hundreds + hundreds of thousands every day. Bully! Also, goddamnit, I'm making around <span class="unclear ">[7000?]</span> iron man a year, and I've a big family that can use it!</p>

      <p>God is good to Christians like you and me, Comrade! And now <u>your Book</u>! And then your next Book all about a poet who loves you. Yes, God's good to the devout.

        That was a <u>proof</u> of our real friendship - subconscious friendship. You <u>did</u> dream into me, and I <u>did</u> get my mood across to you. You'd always get me in my deadly serious moods.</p>

      <p>Did you hear of Sterling's suicide? I was deepest in my gloom when that happened. One of the boys at the P-D brought the news in to my office as soon as it arrived, and it cut deep into my bowels. That was a dismal day. I have a little thing about him in my next issue.</p>

      <p>As to reading your MS + talking it over with you, I'll have my column stuff ahead so that I can soldier when you are here. I am quite free at the office - no one punches the clock on me. I come + go like a gentleman nobody sees my copy or has anything to do with the getup of my page. I have to attend to every little detail even the making of cuts and bases and the choosing of type fonts and the arranging of features. It's quite interesting.</p>
