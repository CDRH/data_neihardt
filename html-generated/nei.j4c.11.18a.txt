      <span class="salute">My dear Mrs. Weston:</span>

      <p>The two lectures on POETIC VALUES are entitled "Science and Poetry" and "The Creative Dream". These, I understand, are to be given in the evening. My readings in the mornings will be from THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS, which is a part of my Epic Cycle of the West. From the Song of the Indian Wars I shall probably want to read the two sections called "The Beecher's Island Fight" and "The Death of Crazy Horse". Each of these is short enough to leave me time for some lyrics.</p>

      <p>A formal contract is not necessary. You need only state the price for the four lectures.</p>
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very truly yours,</span>

         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
