      <span class="dateline">Saturday Morning - 
    <br/>
    Feb. 2, 1929.</span>    
      <span class="salute">Dear Fairy Lady, — </span>

      <p>But a very <u>real</u> "fairy" - that <u>fades</u> away only to come back again with The "Magic Box" filled to overflowing with Joy and Happiness for the day!</p>

      <p>Sometime when I am feeling a bit stronger may I write on greater length and tell you some of the reasons that made yesterday's 
    
    
    few precious moments with the beloved poet, John G. Neihardt, a golden milestone in memory's treasure-logs? You see I have been one of the unfortunate flu victims. Pictures and the "after effects" are <u>not so good</u>, — so this faithful <em class="hi">pen</em> of mine has had a long rest - <u>also</u>! I <u>have</u> written you once before <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>, - + you <span class="unclear ">[were so?]</span> gracious as to like the poem, "Success" I enclosed in that letter -</p> 

      <p>Long years ago, when a child I lived in far away Montana,
    
    
    first at Ft. Caster - later at an Indian Trading Post - on the Big Horn River. Huntley is the name in that village - Indians were the principal inhabitants in those long ago years I learned to <span class="unclear ">[know them well?]</span> + they called my young and beautiful mother, "The White Angel". I am wondering if by any chance <span class="unclear ">[Mr.?]</span> Neihardt was ever at Ft. Custer or Huntley - Of course, <del/> it is all very different out then now compared to forty years ago!</p>

    
      <p>John G. Neihardt is wonderful — Nebraska — and the whole world have reasons to be very proud of him! One of the finest things, in my own humble opinion that this friend who has "The Heart of a <u>Man</u> &amp; the soul of a Poet"<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> wrote</p>

      <p>"Prayer for Pain" - you may know the poem, but just to be sure, when I write you again, I shall enclose the lines.</p>

      <p>
         <u>The "Children's Hours" this morning was delightful. But oh!</u> 
         <em class="hi">Where</em> 
         <u>was</u> 
         <em class="hi">our</em> 
         <u>Blair. We missed him exceedingly.</u>
      </p>

      <p>And now, - <u>"A Happy Day</u> to <em class="hi">you</em> all day" - + throughout all the days &amp; your <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> life!</p> 
      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">- Sincerely,</span> "<span class="unclear ">[?]</span>Lady in<span class="unclear ">[?]</span>."</span>
