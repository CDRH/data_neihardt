                <p>Where are you, and how are you, and is everything all right?? I am so grateful for the happy time we had together in your House of Happiness. I am especially grateful for the evening you, Bower, Beverly, Martha, and I spent together! We <u>did</u> have such an <u>ambrosial</u> evening!! <u>If that was wrong in any way</u>, then
                
                
                
                
                I am a hopeless sinner, and I'm proud of it! There are not too many times in a lifetime when good people actually know and trust each other and are happy together with their hair down! And it made me deeply happy to see old Bower let loose and <u>what good</u> company he is!</p>
                
                <p>The summer is passing rapidly now, &amp; soon
                
                
                    
                
                
                we'll be back on the job. I hope I shall be able to do some good, for otherwise I have little desire to strive. I am not cynical or pessimistic, and I do love people and animals and trees and <del/> bushes and grasses. But I suspect worldly values are a bit phony and maybe I'm ready to go on to the Great Adventure.</p>
                
                
                
                
                <p>But you, dear, lovely lady, are dear to me, and your dear ones are dear to me too. I feel now that Bower and I are closer than ever before, and I am so glad.</p>
                
                <p>Love to you, Bower, Stewart, and sweet, precious Perky! (Love also to Martha and Beverly if they are there and what dear girls and good scouts they are!</p>
