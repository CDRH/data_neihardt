                <span class="salute">Dear Mr. Pulitzer:</span>
                
                <p>It was very kind of you to send me Mr. Stokes' encouraging letter and I <del>thank you</del> am grateful.</p>
                
                <p>Last evening I received the following telegram from the John Day Co., publishers:
                    
                    <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[Having seen?]</span>
         </del>
                    Considering the <u>great probability</u> that the President made <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> statements in his book that the Powers above the President wish to suppress, I am wondering if I am <del>bound by</del> in any way bound by honor to <del/>return the book <u>without first examining it</u>. <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> compare the statements <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>I feel almost sure that <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del> Very likely something <del/>of importance would be revealed by comparing the suppressed edition with the published edition.
                        <div class="note">(over)</div>
                        <del>I am <span class="unclear ">[writing?]</span> you Will you please <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>If you should</del>
                    
                    
                    
                    <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[am asking?]</span>for your advice<span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del>
                        "Will you please advise me?"</p>
                
                <p>
         <del>
            <span class="unclear ">[With kind thoughts?]</span>
            <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del>
      </p>
                
                <p>I should like to feel free to make the comparison I suggest, <del>It could be done
                Yet</del> yet it could be done in such a way that I alone should be responsible for the act.</p>
