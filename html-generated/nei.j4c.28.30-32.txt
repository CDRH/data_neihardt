                <p>It has just occurred to me that I should tell you something important before I forget it. Here it is: You should read Egon Friedel's <u>Cultural History of the Modern Age</u>. I've thought of this often, but never remembered it at the right time. You need not read more than Volume II — the first three chapters thereof especially. This will give you a background of strong historical
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    support for the main thesis of my critical writing from 1912 to 1936. It's about <u>time moods</u>. When I was writing I had not seen the work. It is not that my thesis is like Friedel's <del>his</del> but that his historical discussion 
                    supports <u>my</u> 
         <em class="hi">argument</em>. His work was translated from the German in 1931 (You know, of course, I am thinking of my attitude toward the present time-mood and my explanation of it — often sketched in my article.)</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>I hope everything is going well with you'ns, and I feel it is so. I'm planning the trip for July. Will write Bower soon.</p>

                <p>The Uni. of Neb. Press offers me a contract for republication of <u>Black Elk Speaks</u> ("a great book", "a very beautiful book") in a "quality paper" edition. I accepted, but the contracts stipulate that I shall furnish <em class="hi">three copies</em> 
         <u>of the original edition</u>! I have no three copies to give, and you know how difficult they are to get. I don't know what will be done.</p>
