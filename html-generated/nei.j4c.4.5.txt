      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:—</span>


	     <p>Send me your magazine for the enclosed dollar. I wish I were able to buy a thousand subscriptions. Sterling gave me a copy of the first issue, and it's great stuff. Your work on Religion promises to be a masterpiece. I read "Spring Song" to my wife, and she wept — though she is no sentimentalist. Also, I felt something like smoke in my throat.</p>

	     <p>Success to you!</p>

      <p>I have only now found a dollar that I could tear away from the Grocer, Butcher, et al, and here it is.</p>
