      <span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

      <p>I hope you don't get out of patience with me because of my neglect to write. I am looking forward eagerly to the Notes and will supply any information that seems necessary. The trouble with this job is that my vineyard goes uncultivated. But I'm sure that by this time next year I'll be able to go ahead with the work that matters. I enclose you a circular setting forth the purpose and plan of the All-America Movement. We have put this up to several important St. Louisans and they were enthusiastic. I don't bank on this, of course; it is at the moment only a feeler. I am going after a board of advisors all over the country. Let me know what you think of the scheme.

    If we can put this over even in a fairly modest way, it will make real money and do some good. I have you in mind for one of the sheperds to go with the flock.</p>

      <p>For a good many years I've had a new type lawn mower in mind -- one that will cut grass at any stage of growth with equal ease. Lately an inventive friend here advised me to get it patented if possible, and I am having search made in Washington to see if my scheme has been anticipated. If it hasn't, the chances are pretty good, for it's really a rather clever and effective device.</p>

      <p>Do you still think of hooking up with Macmillans? If you could do this in a way advantageous to you it would be vastly encouraging to me, and I'd be sure then that the cycle would win in our time. I'll be pushing the thing on the road next year myself.</p>

      <p>If you favor the All-American Movement I wish you'd suggest people for our board of advisors and consent to be on it yourself.</p>
