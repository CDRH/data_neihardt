                <p>No rain here for weeks and weeks and weeks. — and no word from you either for quite a spell. I do hope you are well.</p>
                
                <p>You asked if I was a prosperous bean farmer. No, I'm a poor <u>hay</u> farmer — had to cut the beans for hay, which I sold in the field at a fair price. So I didn't go into bankruptcy. I'm trying to get a crop of wheat planted
                
                
                
                
                in the hope of being a wealthy wheat farmer next summer.</p>
                
                <p>I'll leave here the 12th, and reach N. Y. by jet the same day. Will talk that night at the annual dinner of the Westerners. Then I'll have three days in N. Y. before going to <del>Cor<span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
         </del> Cornell University for the 17th, 18th, and 19th. I'm not especially eager to go, but I'll accumulate eagerness when I get started!</p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>Our horses made a great showing <del/> yesterday &amp; the day before at Shelbina. The judges were from Ann Arbor. The horses were the best in the country, and most of the <u>big</u> horse trainers and owners (the big-time boys) were there. We won 7 ribbons — 2 second places, 4 third place, one fourth place. These were <del>aga</del> all won against big fields of top horses and <u>big names</u>. (The latter
                
                
                
                
                are important even with honest judges.) The <u>seconds</u> were as good as firsts, so far as merit was concerned. We were delighted. The judges spoke to us afterwordsafterwards &amp; one said, "You should come into our country. You have horses good enough for any <span class="unclear ">company[?]</span>
         <del/> anywhere." And we haven't yet shown Bourbon Stonewall, the exquisitely beautiful and extremely gifted stallion!</p>
