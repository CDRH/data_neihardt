                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
            
                <p>Yes, it  <u>was</u> truly a lovely week, and <u>is</u>! If it isn't any more, it never was; and if this happy doctrine is at odds with the universe, then I have no compliments for the Cosmic Plan! (Wow!) I'm betting on a <u>waking Now</u> that never turns to dream.</p>
                
                <p>I'm glad to know that some of the fine people I met have said kind things of me what I did. It's good that I did not let you and Bower down. Thanks, thanks for telling me.</p>
                
                <p>You speak of "next year" when we
                    
                
                    
                    <div class="note">16</div>       
         <div class="note">Aly</div>
                
                
                shall repeat the experience. Next year seems far off, and I like to think that you and Bower will be in the Mid-West during early summer, and that we may be able to explore Bancroft and Wayne. Wouldn't that be fun — for me at least!</p>	
                
                <p>Hurrah for the Greek project and for those who will share the adventure with you! You make me want to share.<del/> 
         <div class="note">I'll look at my old grammar.</div> 
         <del/>When I am at Skyrim again, I hope I can get straightened out and feel creative.<del/> I want to very much. I've been a bit upset,
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    Lucile, and am yet. I like to <u>be</u> and <u>say</u> and give the best I've got; and I <u>have</u> given at every opportunity. But the old drive to "make" — I'll really try, though; really. At any rate "I Shall Be Young with You" should come through. <u>Your wanting me to do these things is a powerful stimulus</u>.</p>
                
                <p>On May 2nd Thomas Hart Benton and I are to "discuss<del/> modern trends in art" at the Christian College banquet. Of course, I'll not discuss painting, but I can
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    say something with meaning about Poetry, Literature in general, the cultural mood. I'm full of that and I know what I know. I've made it clear that there will be <u>no debate</u>. As friends, we will say what we see and know and feel. There'll be no rancor in my remarks — no hopeless view. They have asked also that I give some of my poetry. I gave lyrics to that crowd of girls twice, and my golly! how they <u>did</u> respond!</p>

                <p>Tomorrow (Thurs.) evening I must do a program in the big ballroom at the Student Union. It's a dinner. Hilda will be there with bells on too! Now if I just had you to give the Introduction, Lucile, we'd wreck the joint!</p>
                
                <p>But I'm not kidding about your Introductions. They are expert and beautiful — smooth as a bird's wing. <u>And they introduce</u>. I do love the way you do the job.</p>
                
                
                
                
                
                <p>The little box got started your way yesterday. It's from Mona and John to Lucile. I was sorry to note a slight imperfection that wasn't there a year ago. But it is hardly to be noticed. Mona must have dropped the pin. She wore it nearly every day.</p>
                
                <p>Irving Dilliard was here the other day for the Journalism School's big international doings. He came to see me, and we
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    spent a happy hour-and-a half together remembering old days on the P-D — better P. D. days they were too — and recalling what Geo. S. Johns or O. K. Bovard said! When Dilliard arrived in my office, he said: "John, I want to embrace you!" And I said: "Dilliard, I want to embrace <u>you</u>. So we hugged each other and when he left, we repeated the operation, good and hard!
                    
                    
                           <div class="note">3-11-59</div>
                    
                    
                    When he came from Harvard to the P-D he wrote for me. I remember telling him one day that he could go about as far as he might want to go. I felt the stuff in him then. He is too big for the present P-D., but he is too wise to be very unhappy.</p>
