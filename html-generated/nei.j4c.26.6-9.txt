                    <p>Here is a note that you may want. I send it before I forget about it. I have a <del>Mary</del>Susan Craig in 
                        <u>Epic America</u> who grew up knowing about me because she lived in Columbus, Nebraska, and knew Congressman Edgar Howard, who was, for many years owner and editor of the Columbus Daily Telegram. He was a 
                        <u>personage</u>, widely known for his progressive views and his courage. He was a 
                        <u>radical</u> in the strict sense, just as I was. For many 
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        years, <del>Mary</del>Susan Craig tells me, he ran editorials in the Daily Telegram from <del/> time to time on me and my work, and she was aware of them. <del>Mary</del>Susan brought me the one I enclose which, she believes appeared in the forties — the mid- or late-forties. He was then still in Congress, I believe. The editorial I enclose is reminiscent of a rather longish editorial he wrote when the Nebraska Legislature passed the law making me Poet Laureate.
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Howard was amused — and expressed his amusement — over the apparent fact that the Legislature <u>did not know the kind of man and poet it had honored</u>!! Then the cuss quoted <u>The Red Wind Comes</u>, and, I believe, something from <u>The Cry of the People</u>. Anything Howard wrote attracted attention <del/> in those days, but if his editorial harmed me in any way, I didn't hear about it. (At the time Nebraska had

                    <p>I send also a copy of an inscription Howard wrote in a copy of House's <u>Man and Poet</u> presented to Susan Craig's brother, Robert.</p>
