      <span class="salute">Dear Sterling:—</span>


      <p>Had a bully time at Lincoln on the 18th when they pulled off the official "coronation". I spoke twice and read twice. I've had more than one enthusiastic audience, but I never before experienced so much enthusiasm. It rather staggered me. Just before they took me to the K. C. <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="sleeper​ ">sleper</a>
    ​, a committee from the University waited on me and asked if I would care to live in Lincoln for a suitable salary without duties. Have been assured since that the thing is certain to be done.</p>

      <p>This has been a rather spectacular business, but it has certainly been of great value to the work I'm doing — which was the purpose of the promoters.</p>

      <p>I'm pretty sure that I shall see you in October or November if you're still among the living and still care as much for me — or half as much — as I do for you.</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Affectionately always,</span>

         <br/>Jno.
