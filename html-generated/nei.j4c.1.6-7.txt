      <span class="salute">My dear Mr. Davis:—</span>


	     <p>I have just been thinking, since receiving yours
of the 6th, how fortunate it is to have a man, whom one has
never seen, trying to discover one! I have conceived such
a feeling of gratitude toward you that is my intention to
keep hammering away at you, that you may be the man who finds
me, if I ever find myself.</p>

	     <p>Sometimes, this every day endeavoring to force a trumpet—
cry out of the throat of a gnat seems humorous to me. I have
long walks in which I laugh at myself— then I come back and
go at it again.</p>

	     <p>Today I had a walk, and the result of it is recorded here:</p>

      <span class="lg">
         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">I'm a roaming in the tall, tall woods;</span>
            <span class="l">I'm a yelling for to be found out:</span>
            <span class="l">I'm willing to deliver an assorted lot of goods</span>
            <span class="l">To the fellow that'll hear my shout.</span>
            <span class="l">I'm a ranting, nervous cuss, and I want to make a fuss,</span>
            <span class="l">I can soar as high as buzzard ever hovered:</span>
            <span class="l">It's my petted superstition I'm a genius with a mission -</span>
            <span class="l">And I want to, want to, want to be discovered!</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">I'm game to do the real right thing!</span>
            <span class="l">W'y, I'm even game to be damn <u>good</u>!</span>
            <span class="l">(If it's really very very absolutely necessary;</span>
            <span class="l">Or at least I'd be as <u>careful</u> as I could.)</span>
            <span class="l">I'm drunken with a hot mixed dream!</span>
            <span class="l">Here's a pile of chips on <u>me</u> — let's see it covered!</span>
            <span class="l">Do I think I'll reach the wire in a walk? Well I should scream!</span>
            <span class="l">So I want to, want to, want to be discovered.</span>
         </span>

         <span class="lg">
            <span class="l">I'm a virgin country aching for a plow;</span>
            <span class="l">I'm a howling coast anhungered for a sail:</span>
            <span class="l">I wish the Afterwhile would condescend to be the Now!</span>
            <span class="l">-Mr. Christopher Columbus, hit the trail!</span>
            <span class="l">Sometime I'll split the spaces with a yell</span>
            <span class="l">That'll sound as high as buzzard ever hovered:</span>
            <span class="l">And if I fail to do it, I will bow and go to — well,</span>
            <span class="l">I want to, want to, want to be discovered!</span>
         </span>
      </span>






	     <p>All of which proves that all the good poems were <u>not</u>
written by Alfred Austin. You will notice with what consummate
mastery I have used repetition in the final lines of each
stanza, producing a sort of battering ram effect, and fairly
beating it into the head of the awed reader that I really
do wish to be found out. I confess that the morals of the
thing are a little askew, but at least they are as good as
Baudelaire's, and the whole thing is a great deal more
intelligible than the Frenchman's output. I have therefore
proven that the thing is, on the whole, as good as some things
in French and English.</p>
	     <p>But, candidly, Mr. Davis, I rather think I can do something
in the line of the dramatic poem! Have been trying it. Do
you think I am wasting my time? I practiced verse long before
I ever thought of prose; began it when I was twelve years old.
I have quite a good deal of stuff, begun in the past three
years, that I think has something in it — maybe not.</p>
	     <p>Thanking you for your interest in me, I am,</p>

      <span class="closer">
         <span class="salute">Very sincerely yours,</span>
         <br/>Jno. G. Neihardt
