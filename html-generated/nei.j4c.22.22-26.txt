                <p>That was a corking good letter, and it makes me happy to know that my comment on the dissertation made you happy. I know the feeling. But your gratitude is more than I deserve, since I was only trying to express my appreciation of a big job finely done.</p>
                
                <p>This "elderly gentleman" appreciates Bower's comment. The lady was thinking of the outside of me, and that is as she saw. Bower <del/>was thinking of the <em class="hi">other</em>, and that does <u>not</u> grow<del/> older; it only becomes more and more <u>aware</u>. I feel this so often.

                    Whatever "power" one may have does seem to increase as the <del>body <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>
            </del> body begins "remembering the ground".</p>
                
                <p>In this connection I am reminded how fortunate Mona is, in that she was not compelled to rot her way slowly out of the physical body, as most people must do. I know this process is, in reality, no more to be deplored than the rotten of a ripe apple; but the apple, presumably, is not self-conscious and cannot compare

                <span class="salute">Dear Lucile:</span>
            
                <p>You see I wasn't able to finish my letter. Things got to happening, and I was doing some extra talking here and there, along with some extra conferences â€” and some weariness. Anyway, hello, dear Lady, how are you?</p>
                
                <p>First, your question about my mother's letters. During the period you mention, there would be letters to her sister, Lora, in Grinnel; but these would be lost. I have no notion that the surviving sons would attach
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    any value to the letters. Also, she would have written to Mrs. James Carey of Bancroft. They were <del/>bosom friends. The Careys were a wealthy family, owning a big implement business. Mrs. Carey has been dead years and years; but her son, <del/> Rex, an old friend of <del/> mine, is living at Dalton, Nebraska. <u>He</u> would be sympathetic &amp; would really care. Try him.</p>
               
                <p>I had a lovely experience with a small group of picked people at the Episcopalian church the other night. They asked
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    me to illustrate my religious concepts with readings from my poetry. I did not in the least intend to make this more than chattily casual. Spoke in a low voice, naturally, the group being small &amp; intimate. But, by golly, 
                    <em class="hi">it</em> 
            <u>happened</u>! It was <u>one of those things</u>. The group looked hypnotized and didn't seem to bat an eye-lasheyelash. I'm telling you because of your importance in my scheme of things; and you know I'm not boasting. I <u>don't</u> know clearly why
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    that sort of thing happens. It can't be intentional on my part, and I don't feel I'm that "good". The feeling is like being a little while in heaven, and I feel of no importance at all during, and, especially, after the event. It's the miracle of perfect communication for a little while.</p>
             
                <p>This seems to happen to some who watch my television program. I get this through verbal reports, largely. Dr. Scherr's sister, for instance, is reported as saying she felt "hypnotized". (This sounds funny to me, 
                    
                    
                     
                    
                    in a way. Is it the <u>sound</u> that does it, I wonder. A woman told me her little girl in primary school watches every time and forgets to play with her hula hoop. I asked <u>what</u> she could be getting; and the woman said she thought it was the flow of the verse. If so, that's important for it tends to justify my poetic form. There's a lot of comment, all of the same general sort. Only a small fraction gets into letters but those you shall see later.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    I'm deeply interested in your review of the <u>Wars</u> &amp; how I'd love to be hiding under a chair during your presentation!</p>
                
                <p>Will you use any of the tape?</p>
                
                <p>I've had a <u>brilliant</u> idea! Sometimes I'm almost smart! It's this! I'll <u>buy</u> a <del/> tape-recorder, and I'll be able to swamp you with material, as well as give full answers to your questions. It's the only way.</p>
