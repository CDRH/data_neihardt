Precious Amama:
<p>Your special delivery arrived while we were having breakfast, and Mona has just left.</p>
<p>It is good fo you - and characteristic to rush to Mildred's aid. We will tell Hilda, and no doubt you will hear from her by phone next Sunday. Your pretty, friendly room is waiting patiently for you across the hall, and we had looked forward eagerly to your being in it soon. But you are doing night, and a delay will not matter when it's over.</p>
<p>I could go to Lincoln, it seems' but not with salary enough to justify moving there. My friends feel sure that, sometime later on, a lectureship could be arranged at the University to supplement income form the State Historical Society job. But that is too vague to justify a move. Friends in both Kansas City and Chicago are working for me, and it now seems that we'll be in one of these places. In the meanwhile, I'm getting well enough to handle a job; and two weeks ago I was far from able. The osteopath is really doing wonderfully ; and I'm sure now that I'll be all right. If I had only known of this, man last fall! I do greatly dislike the present arrangement! Altho Mona and I are happy together - like a couple of kids. But there's no use in deploring anything, and I know the outcome will be good.</p>

<p>George Leon and his Grandmother have received their re-entry permits at last, and the <sic>troup</sic> will be headed for Mexico City early this week - perhaps today! Isn't that bully!! So Alice will be on the wing again, "high-hearted with a hunger for the new"!</p>
<p>We three are going to be happy together! I'd you know that? <sic>Wel</sic>, it's so!</p>
<p>The same love to you, Amama! Keep on being a Good Girl!</p>

<p>Kindest thoughts for Ottocar, Dick, and their ladies.</p>
