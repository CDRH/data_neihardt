<underline>Next Day</underline>
Dear Ones - All Six:
<p>Arrived at 5:20, leaving Enat's at 10:20. Nice trip. Never saw the house <unclear/> Alice's shoes, the beds just as they were slept in, the "pinkling" cans &amp; little chairs &amp; table didn't make the house seem any less empty.</p>
<p>But it was bully to be with you all &amp; to see how nicely you are situated. Mama and I must run up at reasonable intervals &amp; see you all. No reason why not.</p>

<p>Sig, the side mirror is a comfort in driving, and I'm mighty glad for the safe tires. Don't let yourself entertain any doubts about your great purpose. You can't be beatean. But you must feel around for new advantages of the sort you talked about to me.</p>
<p>I lvoe each of you separately for a special reason, and <underline>all</underline> of <underline>you</underline> collectively for the same reason.</p>
Dad.
