Dear Enot and Oddie:
<p>I'm sending the trinkets for the Wub celebration. The rose-quartz set is designed to attract the youngster's attention when it is nursing. If it grabs an earring and tears it off, don't spank its bottom. That was the original idea in making the set.</p>
<p>The ring is really strong now - <underline>no</underline> cement between the stone and the ivory. There are some rather neat mechanical doing inside. The setting for the jad is sard, which was regarded in ancient Rome as the prince of gem-stones, oddly enough.</p>

<p>The fastener for the heart was made to be used with a silk cord, which, by the way, would be better fo rthe amethyst heart also.</p>
<p>I hope you like the ring, which is really a brand - new one. The stone set on <strike/> yellow sapphire is a really fine carbuncle (garnet) and you will find beautiful lights in it.</p>
<p>I hope, Oddie, you may want to use the pin regularly. It's not flashy. The jade is really a fine piece.</p>
<p>We think of you two, no, <underline>three</underline>, so much, and we love you.</p>
Dad.
<p>To remove the pin guard, pull on the little ball at the end.</p>
