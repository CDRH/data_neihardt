6 Dear Mrs. Berg 
36
Since I am so far away from you I'm going to indulge in the old saw time and tide waits for no man, I shall not attempt to apologize for the length of time that has Elapsed since the receipt of your good letter. I have thot of you often tho. Isn't it just wonderful that we can go on thinking no difference what task claims us. I have at last the book I wish to send you. Got it just in time for John to Autograph before leaving for Nebr. last Sat. morning. Now that I think of it I am afraid you will be gone when this reaches Pender but it will be there when you get back. I think you said you hoped to be present Neihardt day I hope you will be, and please tell me every thing, John is always so tree when he gets home that we never gets home that we never get just the things we want most to know I shall be there in spirit. And I am

happy that there is to be such a thing as Neihardt Day. I am so grateful to all you good understanding people that have made it possible. We all know how much we owe you and are grateful indeed. 
I am so tired tonight and I feel like anything but waiting a letter and especially to try to ans. you so you will pardon the little snatchy lines I am putting down here. And please know that I love to write you and will do so later. I have not been well. I am very dicouraged somedays I went to be will so much, ther are so many things to Enjoy, lent it is hard to see things whole when one has to be bother with ones old shill. Next year will bring even greater things for John I do hope you will see him the 11th and have a talk with him. I feel as tho he will be seeing a very dear friend. I wonder what <del/> we were to EAch other before this life and what will it be the next. My love to you,
Alice M. Neihardt
