Darling Children all three!
<p>Your good letters Ollie dear, and all you say about Enid's canning etc, make me understand perfectly that she has been far too busy to write. I have news of you from Hilda too so I feel very well treated all'round.</p>
<p>I am very glad Max and my Wubs were out to visit our one and only <underline>grand-son</underline>!</p>
<p>So glad too that dear Mother Fink has been with you!</p>
<p>Now I feel selfish but I do want to ask you to</p>

<p>send my dry clay. I need it. Let me Know what it cost to send it <underline>please</underline> or I'll send you too much! I have a good chance to make a little something on blackout lamps it seems, and I need clay to make the model. As for Nei's bust: you can do it Ollie dear, but if it makes you nervous to do so, <underline>don't</underline> or if you are too busy with your garden - and when we return we ill make the cast. Just Keep the mold <underline>closed</underline>, so that it does not <underline>warp</underline>, adn then when we return we will soak it up and make the cast.</p>
Loads of Love to you from a very busy old
Mama Mother
