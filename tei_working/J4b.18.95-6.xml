Dear Ollie, Enot and Nei:
<p>We were happy to hear from you, as always. I can see old Nei jumping in the jumper and shouting with glee! Whenever I think of him, which is often, I feel a happy tickle all through me. He's the dogonedest, baby-boyest baby boy I've know to date. Does he often go down to the gold-fish beach for a foot-swim?</p>
<p>Peaches are doing their stuff now and we've been wondering what to do about then. A neighbor hauls them from Nashville, Ark., which is the capital of the great peach country, &amp; he sells them for $1, a bushel. They're real, peachy peaches. If we can a lot, as we are tempted to do, how do we get them up to Overland? If we only knew there'd be a car available! I wonder if it wouldn't pay to</p>

<p>ship canned stuff anyway. Of course we don't know where we'll be, but in any case we'd want to share with you folks. Can you get good peaches there for $1 a bu.?</p>
<p>Everything goes finely here - happy &amp; harmonious. Amama gets better &amp; better and seems so much freer mentally, and so much gentler.</p>
<p>In addition to Kemper, I've approached Culver and the U. of Neb. I'll let you knwo the worst or best.</p>
<p>Did you finally get the garden softened up after the rains?</p>
<p>When it rains seriously in this country, the growth is magical. When Indiana &amp; Illinois <strike/> corn was knee-high, Mrs. Cantwell's corn was higher than her head! But this country will not stand any drouth.</p>
<p>I often think of you &amp; see you doing things. It's almost like being there.</p>
<p>When you pour the bust, remember to soak the mould first &amp; drain.</p>
Endless love to all three, 
Dad.
