Dear Mama:-
I was so glad to hear from you, and I hope to hear again before I leave here, tho' I may not. I don't feel just certain that you are entirely over your adventure. With the potato chiop. You should know pretty well by now. Mrs. Emma Ward is attending school here now. Had a nice little talk with her. She was at the <unclear/> club picnic last evening. Mrs. Conn spoke so in such a feartfelt way of you last evening - so generously & warmly. I'm surprised more than ever with the each

enjoyment in this country. Kids can't have any fun in a natural way, nothing but little filfthy mud hole to seven in, and hardly any of those. All the rest is corn fields & dusty roads I wonder what kids do here. It's even worse than when I was a lord, because the cake has disappeared, hardly a marsh <unclear/> left. 
It's been over 100 here several times, & 98 has been common. Yesterday was <unclear/> & so is today. I suppose a <unclear/> wave has struck you by now. Hope so.

Mary is anxious to get to Branson. You must study to maintain the friendliest of relations with her. She's a nice girl, but she's pretty young in the head yet. I feel sure you'll like her. She wants to get up an orchestra in the school, & I judge that she is plenty able to do it. <del/> That would keep her occupied outside of school. When I leave here on the way back, I'm to check mary's trunk home on my ticket. 
Lots & lots of love. I do hope you are entirely over the <unclear/> trouble. 
Jno.

P.S. 
Mary graduated at Chicago University more than a month earlier than Doctor expected last April. She has her A. B. degree & her diploma she has done practice teaching in the Chicago schools besides in the training school. 
She isn't a bit cocky, I'm glad to say
