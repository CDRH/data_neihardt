Dr. &amp; Mrs. Slade Kendrick,
         Ithaca, N. Y.



<p>Dear Friends:</p>

	<p>Well, I'm here again - with precious memories and a heartful of thankfulness. I have seldom been as happy outside my own home as I was in yours. Mona has heard all about you, and she shares in my affectionate thoughts of you two dear people.</p>
	<p>Mona opened the surprise envelope, and it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> a surprise truly - quite pleasing in the worldly sense, of course, but appreciated more as a further expression of your kindness, Slade, for I know it was your doing. Many thanks!</p>

	<p>I was rather weary when I reached home Sunday evening. It's a long, long wait in St. Louis and the station seats <hi rend="underline">are</hi> hard. But I rested on Monday and was ready for my Tuesday classes. During my absence, Nita, Mona decorated half of the house at least - and what a difference! I don't know how she did it all in so short a time. I mention this because you spoke of going after your home in the same way.</p>
	<p>I think often of Dr. Thompson, and I hope I may see him again in this world. Please tell our lexicographer friend that I am sorry I could have no good talk with him, for I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> feel something special about him too. They were all fine, the men I met.</p>

	<p>Do let me know about <hi rend="underline">the Book's</hi> adventures among publishers. How I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> want to see it in print. As I think of it, I have a <hi rend="underline">good feeling</hi> with no back thoughts. It is so reasonable, so well-ordered; and it places no burden upon normal credulity, arouses no antagonism. Also it <hi rend="underline">flows</hi> along with no shocks, and ends in a quiet beauty.</p>
	<p>Yesterday was a stifling hot day. Some youngsters fainted in crowded schoolrooms. Today is quite cool. What strange weather - upset just as man's world is! We need rain again.</p>

        <p>Love to you, dear people.</p>
