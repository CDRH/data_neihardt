                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>You were kind to answer my request for information. The paper on which I was working was not a thesis for a degree (Northwestern will not permit a thesis any more) but was a statement of epic development in America, with particular emphasis upon your work. I was successful in convincing the members &#8212; and faculty &#8212; of my seminar that <hi rend="double underline">you</hi> rather than <unclear>Ben&#233;t</unclear>, Jeffers, Robinson, Eliot, Pound, Hovey, Moody, represent epic as it must be. The several poets were fired at me by various people, each of whom had a theory. There are moments, sir, when I am mightily in-clined to shout about other values in literature and living which seem to elude the precious analyses of Waldo Frank, the Chicago Remaissance, <unclear>regionalism</unclear>, and the like. It seems, of late, that people insist upon attitudes in every blessed effort they make. I prefer to climb when I

                    can afford it.</p>
                
                <p>If you'll permit, I want to give you a bit of my background, and then ask another question:
                    <lb/>
                    I am a graduate of Wesleyan University and have been fortunate enough to study under Fred Millet, Alex Courie, and Wilbert Snow, who was my tutor &#8212; I've been attending Northwestern University evenings for several years working on my <hi rend="caps">MA</hi>, and meeting requirements for teaching in Illinois. At present I am assistant headmaster and practically all the English Department at The Chicago Latin School for Boys. As an under-graduate I did my distinction study on Francis Thompson; and again was fortunate, because Father Connolly of Boston College, turned me loose in their Thompson room whenever I made the trip to Boston. On the strength of this rather sketchy background, I want to ask your permission to do my doctoral work on John <hi rend="caps">G.</hi> Neihardt. I don't know specifics as yet because I haven't thought enough on it; and I can't begin until a year from September. But I have 
                
                    <pb facs="nei.j4a.23.11a-11c_0003"/>
                    <fw type="curatorial">11c</fw>
                
                    read everything of yours that I can find in New<unclear/> and Northwestern, and I know that I want to undertake the work when I may. Perhaps you would prefer that I do other work &#8212;&#8212; I know that our trustees expect me to take a doctorate in Education if I ever hope to become head of the school. My wife would never forgive me if I gave in to them. I rather expect it will be easy to arrange my leave of absence when the time comes! One Mark Neville is enough.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks again for your kindness. Could you tell me if Macmillan has any copies of the one-volume "A Cycle of the West"? (I believe that the only books available in Chicago right now are by either Motley or Spillane).</p>

                    <salute>A most happy Easter to you,</salute>
