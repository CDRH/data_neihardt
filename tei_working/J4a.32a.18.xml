Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>On my way to Washington State from New York ( to teach at Central Washington State College) I stopped in Kearney, Nebraska. In a gift store I saw your recent book of poems and glanced thru it to see if the two poems I had set to music many years ago were in-cluded. They were - so I purchased the book and asked the clerk if she knew your present address. She said she would find out and write to me about it.</p>
<p>The two poems which I set to music are LULLABY and FOUNTAIN SONG. They were composed in 1950 and immediately published. They sold very well. I thought you might like to know this.</p> 
<p>If I send you my copy of the book would you be so kind as to inscribe it to me? I should appreciate it very much.</p>
<p>With every kind wish.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Paul Creston</signed>

Reply to Mr. Creston on September 25, 1968, from 5835 Vine St., Lincoln:
Dear Mr. Creston:
I am so glad you finally found out where I live, but why didn't you look in <underline>Who's Who in America</underline>? I am surprised to know that you composed music for two of my poems. Did we have correspondence about the matter? It is encouraging to know they sold well. It occurs to me that it might be nice of you to send me several copies of these songs.
What was done about copyright?
I shall be glad to autograph the book you say you are sending to me.
Sincerely,
