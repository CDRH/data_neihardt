<p>Your dear letter today seemed a bit blue. We here Know you are doing the best possible so clear up and don't take anything as seriously as your old Mom always has done - it does not pay!</p>
<p>We here are ready to help by keeping the Wubs till you are ready for them - which is all we <underline>can</underline> do.</p>
<p>The Bank did not want to give a Loan, but a private party seems ready to do so - it has been a horrid thing for us to go through with but it is all O.K. <underline>if</underline> we can make ends meet and repay before we lose</p>

<p>I am so grateful Sig is doing so well - You shoudl feel the Powers are with you - Raps can do no more than give you that certainty.</p>
<p>Hilda does not write - I cannot understand it.</p>
<p>Our stove will be ready to return to Sears tonight - They asked us to send it, so we are hopeful. We want a word stove in exhange.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful itme at the Show. Joanie was so good and enjoyed nearly everything as well as the cartoon of the 3 Bears. We hope to drive the Wubs and Alice up there when the time comes.</p>
<p>I am so glad Sig and Hilda are practicing - Loads of Love - Mama</p>
