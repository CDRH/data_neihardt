Dearest Ones
<p>before getting lunch I want to say that we are very busy and very happy - I put the "Ad" in the paper - "Modern, 8 room Home, beautiful grovels" in for Sale section. People will be referred to me - and Mr Runyon believes in good results - so here's hoping! I am cleaning the upstairs now after finishing the downstairs. Put the carpet down and made everythign look so beautiful! What a lovely place this <underline>is</underline>!</p>
<p>Joan and Elaine found their big balls and are having a swell time with them - We are eating out of doors-</p>
Loads of love to <underline>all</underline> my darlings from their most grateful and devoted
