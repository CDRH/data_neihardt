My own darling Alice,
<p>You have been in my heart and prayers day and night - and I cannot tell you how eager we are for your release from "prison" because you must feel that way about it. I am so grateful to you for Keeping us informed - please <hi rend="underline">always do that</hi>. I finally found some black people goods and am making a costume for you after a different pattern entirely. When I Know where to send it I shall do so, and want you to tell me exactly what is wrong about it - so that I can make you another one better.</p>
<p>I'm going to be so grateful to Know you all sage in your job</p>

<p>in Mexico City. However I think a tour in Texas might be fine at present. I can feel the anxiety with you all - and yet I have a strong feeling that the worst for you is over now, and that you have decided on some <hi rend="underline">plan of action</hi> by now, that will <sic>releave</sic> the situation.</p>
<p>Hilda is planning to leave by the first of March, and Amama is going to Courtland, N.Y. to visit till something works out for Daddy and me. Meanwhile Daddy is <hi rend="underline">much</hi> better physically, and is trying new ways to obtain a job. I feel he is going to be successful too, without having to go to the East, which we dislike terribly because it represents the lowest in our Land.</p>
Devotedly loveing you
Mama
