Dearest Girl: 
I'll be with you in a few days & so there's nothing really to say. I'm eager to get home, but it woudl be a disapointment for Enid if we didn't go to Big River. They are nice people. I myself want to do a lot of systematic walking & swimming by way of being in good shape for next season here. I've succeeded in re-renting the apartment. We are storing things we dont' want to bring down to Branson. 
Endless love 
Jno 
Love for Amama too.
