Branson Mo.,
My Dear little girl;
Your good letter came at last and I wondered if you felt as I did when <del>yo</del> my letters were so long coming to you. We have all been sick with fear. Grace came home the last of Jan. and was with us all three our Flue spell. She is now getting ready to go to Buffalo N. Y. to take a libraries course. I have bene having a big heart ache, the kind mothers have when their childrens have troubles. Grace and her husband have parted and she is to finish the course. I fI ever see you again I may have to burden you by un-burdening my troubles to you. 
Yes we may got to Lincoln to live I shall be sorry in some ways to leave here, but in others, glad, the hills here are hard for me
