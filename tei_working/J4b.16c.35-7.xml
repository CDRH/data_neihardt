Sat. Night
Dear Enat:
<p>It's just struck me that I have not written you since you wrote that you had completed the corrections! I'm flabbergasted and sorry, because my neglect <strike/> does not express my feeling. I was both glad and grateful. <underline>Don't</underline> send the M S until we get back in the third week of October. I'll have you send it express collect. Express is the cheap way. Mail is frig<underline>htfu</underline>l, as 1<underline>st</underline> class rate is charged. When we come up for a visit - probably Xmas, or maybe Thanksgiving - I'll bring more MS.</p>
<p>I think very often about your <underline>Plan</underline>, and it</p>
37
<p>gives me a thrill. Gaki will surely love that Wub! You know I <underline>do</underline> love Wubs and always did. And this one will be an extra special.</p>
<p>As you may know, Oddie and I have exchanged some silly letters. If you happened to read one <strike/> of mone, you couldn't know how terrible Oddie's provocation was.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to a good time on the Colorado trip, &amp; they've made quite elaborate preparations at Denver. Should be quite an affair - Mama will look lovely in her clothes. <underline>I</underline> have new shoes, and will cross my legs to show them.</p>
Endless love
Dad
<p>It seems to take longer to reach Overland by mail than to reach N.Y. Really.</p>
