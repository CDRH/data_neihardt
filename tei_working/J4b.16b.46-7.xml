Dear Enat:
<p>You said something in your recent letter that struck me at the time as important and beautiful. - your plan for next April or May. It seems so now. I want you to know that I have thought, and what is better, felt much about it, in spite of the momentary tangle of things. You must believe that I am all sympathy, and for long moments I've been inside of you and know just how you feel about it. You're right, and Oddie is a dear for knowing that you are. "She Who Walks with Her Holy Red Staff" - that describes your great gift, and there is no greater one, since all the others dervie from that one.</p>
<p>You know it has a most loving Gaki and Nanny waiting for its arrival.</p>
Endless love, Enot Peanot,
Dad
