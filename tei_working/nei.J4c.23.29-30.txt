<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>I'm almost there! Anyway, I picked up my tickets today. Three more days and we'll be headed your way, at 300 miles per hour! I'll give you the arrival time again: Due at Portland at 8:05 p. m., Friday Feb. 20. Flight 547 United Airlines. Return, leaving Portland 8:20 a. m. Sat. Feb. 28. It seems that we should run up by bus on Friday and spend the

-2-

night in Portland. What's the use in writing when we can talk? <hi rend="underline">I'm so glad I can come</hi>!</p>

					<p>Love to you and yours.</p>
