                <p>Your letter of the 8th inst. received and your note as to colors of troops horses with Custer of 20th; answer to letter enclosed. I am glad to make the statement as to origin of colors of troop horses&#8212;</p>
                
                <p>Again as to Reno: <unclear>Brimmstone</unclear> it seems to me has been too deeply impressed by Slaper. I admit there was excuse for being scared. If Reno had been the Commanding Officer of <unclear/> Troops there would be no question as to having his own judgement whether to advance, stand or retreat &#8212; His was a cooperation from, an adjunct, as it were, to the main body with definite with instructions to <hi rend="underline">charge</hi>&#8212; He not only did not charge but faltered, halted and then fell back to a good defensive position before he had a single casualty + then after a <hi rend="underline">few</hi> casualties he left that good defensive position and led a panic retreat, and where to he knew not &#8212; He did not try to organize any defense while in the woods in the bottom&#8212; He made no effort

                    to control the morale of his troops &#8212; He failed utterly to give any cooperation &#8212; agressive or defensive. He seemed obsessed with the idea to save his own skin &#8212; and succeeded! If his motive was to save his command why did he not take proper <unclear>preventions</unclear> to guard his retreat&#8212; As it was: <unclear>nearly all</unclear> his casualties <unclear>occured</unclear> in his panic <unclear/>&#8212; and further was contributary to the total destruction of the main command&#8212;</p>
                 
                <p>I am reminded of a story told of General Grant&#8212; <unclear>General</unclear> Grant had sent an Aid <del>to</del> with orders for a Division Commander to carry out certain operations. The Division Commander rode in hot haste to Gen Grant, dismounted, saluted and repeated the orders that had been communicated to him and asked if they were correct&#8212; Gen Grant said "Yes"&#8212; The Division Commander then some vehemence, "I suppose, General Grant, you understand that means the destruction of my Division!" General Grant replied: "I am glad General ---- you understand the Orders"! The Division was not destroyed&#8212;</p>

                <p>I confess that when I learned of the testimony of some the officers before the Reno <unclear>first</unclear> of <unclear>ongoing</unclear> I was quite amazed.</p>
                
                <p>Benteen had a splendid War (Civil) <unclear>record</unclear>; he commanded the brigade that changed Marmadukes Command (and captured him I think) in <hi rend="caps">S.W. MO.</hi> He was then Lt Col. of the 10th <hi rend="caps">MO.</hi> Cav. in Gen. Winslow's Division In battle he was bold, <unclear>resourceful</unclear> and alert.</p> 
                
                <p>I was not present when Benteen first saw General Custer's dead body&#8212; I don't know <add>who</add> the two officers of the 7th Cav were who were with him on <unclear>that</unclear> occasion, but I feel sure that Nowlan was one of them&#8212; I first heard of that episode <add>about</add> a year ago&#8212;</p>
                
                <p>No! I do not think Benteen was <unclear/> to the left "Valley Chasing"&#8212; My belief is explained on page 20 of the Pamphlet "Custer's Last Battle" Benteen has spared no opportunity to impugn, disparagingly, every motive of Custer apparently not since the morning we <del/> got the Chicago Times confirming a letter from Gen Whithaker criticizing both Reno and Benteen&#8212; He flew into a violent rage, cursing The "Custerites" and from that time he <hi rend="underline">was</hi> bitter. He and I were on the train to Chicago to attend the Reno Court of Inquiry &#8212;1879&#8212;.</p> 
               
                <p>During that <hi rend="underline">Inquiry</hi> Reno kept "open <unclear>house</unclear>"

                    in his room at the Palmer House, Whiskey and Cigars &#8212; Benteen frequently urged me to visit his rooms but I declined all his <unclear/>, I merely thanked Reno for his invitation&#8212;</p>
