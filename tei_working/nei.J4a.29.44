My dear Doctor Neihardt:
<p>Mrs. Troelstrup sent me the interesting clipping about the birthday celebration.</p>
<p>Doctor Vining is now feeling the whips and scorns of time but is living usefully, albeit a bit irrespons-ibly and unpredictably. I believe he is writing you.</p>
<p>I consider myself a rarely privileged person to have known you. It is one of the most rewarding and stimulating experiences of my life. I am reading your poetry continually and enjoy it just as much as ever.</p>
<p>Permit me to extend to you a very special salutations. No brighter light than yours has been shed on the dark wilderness of thsi world, where the Chorus sings of terror, pity, and the tears of things.</p>
<p>May the richest blessings be your portion.</p>
Faithfully yours,
