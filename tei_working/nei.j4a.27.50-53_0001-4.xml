                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:- </salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I appreciated your letter of February 22. If I ever come to Columbia I will try to meet you personally. Your aquaintance and experiences with the Indian far exceed mine &#8212; which at best is only superficial. However many years of reading and study gave me a better knowledge of them than is usual.</p>
                
                <p>I taught at the Walla Walla <hi rend="caps">W.</hi><unclear/> High School in the spring of 1916 after the return of Dr. Davis to his position at the University of North Dakota. While
                    
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.7.50-53_0002"/>
              
                <fw type="curatorial">51</fw>
                    
                    there I read and visited the local history data. One of the teachers in the High School had married the daughter of a pioneer family that had lived near Dixie Wa eleven miles from Walla Walla. He told me that settlers <unclear/> Whitman <unclear/> were never bothered when Whitman was killed. They said the Whitman settlement had a good garden, including a watermelon patch &#8212; the finest the Indians had ever seen. The Indians raided the watermelons &#8212; and Whitman put poison in the melons &#8212; The Indians killed him for doing that &#8212; and remained friends with the outlying settlers. You can probably verify this &#8212; but it would not be welcome news to the missionary story commonly told. I visited Whitman's grave on the Oregon Washington boundary a few miles South of Walla Walla.</p>

                <p>The Cherokee story in Tennessee was a real tragedy. Sam Houston was raised largely by Indians &#8212; and when he left town, went to the Indian friends in Oklo. Territory &#8212; who talked him back into a saner mood &#8212; and made him fit for his career in Texas. The Cherokees were well on the road to settled condition &#8212; and then still <unclear/> many birch houses built by the Indians between Knoxville and <unclear>Chattanooga</unclear>. Andrew Jackson adopted an Indian boy &#8212; <unclear>when</unclear> family were slaughtered by his frontier-men in the battles in Alabama. This boy died of <hi rend="caps">T.B.</hi> when about grown.</p>
                
                <p>I own and operate a 580 acre farm &#8212; but my great grandfather &#8212; was a pioneer &#8212; who lived east of Brown's Station. My grandfather &#8212; was a Captain with Price's army in the Civil War.  I am much more closely tied in with Brown Co. than <unclear/> I think we would enjoy a visit together.</p>

They are the most authentic descriptions of the Indians as they really were &#8212; before the white men disturbed their culture.</p>
