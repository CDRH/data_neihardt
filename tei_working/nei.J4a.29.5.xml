Dear Old Friend,
<p>So! you are having a birthday! you, your magnificent writings, and your adorable family, are constantly in my thoughts I like to think of you as "resident" on a campus! Fortunate students and Faculty! My brother Julius House, S.A.E. Frat. attended Missouri U. in 1893. I am glad it has remained idealistic and wholesome. So much of the world has lost its <unclear/> of discrimination and appreciation!</p>
<p>Please write me some of the family, I wish I be at the party! My heart will be there and I wish you could have eternal youth and life! A hundred years your now your great lines will be singing strongly in the world, while lesser writings are gone!</p>
<p>So, you really will "live forever"! Sincere affection to all the family and a special wish for you birthday!</p>
Rebon, my son joins me in greetings.
Sincerely, 
Lelah N. Stoker
