Enid darling: 
Such a beautiful place we are in at the food of Pike's Peak - the sky is so blue and the mountains incredibly beautiful
The air is wonderful, and we have not felt hot since yester-day - This is a mile high we have just seen the Garden of the Gods, great stone formations thrust and of the earth a bright brick red against a deep blue sky - The girls are riding horses for 2 hours while Daddy and I are sitting by our cabin resting - Love to Ruth and you
