                    <salute>Dear John &#8212;</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Your last letter has been on my desk a long time &#8212; I am incredulous when I look<del>ed</del> at the date just now &#8212; 1956 &#8212; I carried the letter to Berkeley 2 summers and really have written innumerable letters in my mind and made a few beginnings on paper &#8212; why the block? I honestly don't know &#8212; especially when I tell you that letter writing seems currently to be my chief interest. And let me tell you I would prize a letter from you beyond anything.</p>
              
                <p>Recently I began rereading your epics from the beautiful two volume edition you send me so long ago. It is a pleasure I have been promising myself for some time and I am

                    <fw type="authorial">2</fw> happy to find that your poetry seems to me as beautiful as when I read it years ago the first time. It seems so carefully and lovingly finished and has a tremendous feel of the country and seasons and men &#8212; I shouldn't be offering literary criticism, not being experienced but I am simply telling how your poetry affects me &#8212; Later I am going back to the lyrics &#8212; a fine prospect for me to enjoy.</p>
                
                <p>So you know Edith <del>Hamilton's</del> Hamilton's The Greek Way? We read the first chapter last night and are looking forward to more &#8212; Frank is not only a scientist but a philosopher who exemplifies his belief in his life and is altogether a most satisfying companion &#8212; It seems hardly just

                    <fw type="authorial">2</fw> that I should have two perfectly happy marriages in my life when so many of my friends testify to the exact opposite &#8212;</p>
                
                <p>Los Angeles is not an ideal home site but it can be endured quite comfortably if one looks for means of happiness &#8212; One of the best things about the place is the proximity of the ocean, the mountains and the desert &#8212; In the fall we make numerous trips to a high mt. canyon (5,000 ft up the side of Mt. San Gorgonio) where the apples grow &#8212; If there is time we make a two day outing of the trip and bring back apples and cider to enjoy for days afterwards. In December we always <del>make</del> have a vacation

                    <fw type="authorial">3</fw> in the desert and again in the spring to enjoy the show of wild flowers&#8212;</p>
                
                <p>The best part of Los Angeles for Frank is that there is a College of Optometry where they are glad to have <del/> him for a teacher, tho<sic>though</sic> he long since retired from Stanford for age &#8212; Here he can spend his whole time on research on the eye and teach young people &#8212; So, tho<sic>though</sic> my heart draws me to Berkeley where most of the children and grandchildren are living I know we shall continue in this ugly city as long as Frank can go up and down stairs and handle classes &#8212;</p>
                
                <p>You must be in much the same situation in Missouri &#8212;

                    <fw type="authorial">4-</fw> Do they not have a retiring age in Missouri or have they made an exception for you?</p>
                
                <p>We are in the midst of another hot spell and I am staying home quietly &#8212; usually on Monday &amp; Tuesday, the days Frank teaches, I gad about and visit friends, but when it is so hot home is best.</p>
