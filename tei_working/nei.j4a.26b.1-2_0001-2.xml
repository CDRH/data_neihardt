                    <salute>Dear John: -</salute></opener> <p>It was good to hear from you who have been so often in my thoughts, and I am sure in Nita's, too. You see your visit had made you dearer to us. And then there is your loss, and the courage with which you carry on.</p>
                
                <p>And how very fortunate that you have other interests, the lectures, and contacts at Yankton, Mrs. Aly's dissertation and biography. And now the wonderful opportunity that has opened for you in television. You will reach many, and they will respond to you. And the torch of life given and received will revive your spirit. How I wish I were in the receiving range!</p>
                
                <p>I still hear good words concerning your appearances here. Dr. Burtt, the neighbor-philosopher, spoke most cordially of you the other day. Dr. Wilcox, the 97 year old gentleman, said he had

                    not been so moved in 75-years. He heard you recite "Sitting Bull." In a letter Rev. Christie, <del>said,</del> after expressing regret that he could not attend your last reading, said, "I can't imagine anything finer than my two experiences of a quiet, warm, mystic personality who bought into my life a new assurance of the grandeur of life and of faith. Neihardt is a giant in everything but stature! To see him is to love him, both as poet and as man.</p>
                
                <p>"My experience with Neihardt was a profound spiritual adventure."</p>
                
                <p>Prof. Elder, the bearded Englishman, said in a letter "There is certainly something about John Neihardt which endears him to me and I am most grateful to you for making our meeting possible. I list the event as one of the major ones of my life."</p>
                
                <p>We have returned recently from a trip to Ill. to see our little granddaughter. On the way back we came by <del/> Mechanicsburg Pa. to see the litle grandson. <del>B</del> They seemed fine to us. We took a nice trip to Kentucky, saw some beautiful horses. I patted War Admiral, most famous son of Man O' War</p>
                
                <p>I expect to <del>to</del> visit my brother the latter half <del><unclear>part</unclear></del> of July, and shall, of course, plan to see you.</p>
