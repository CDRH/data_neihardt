Dearest Enid:
<p>Your lovely letter made us very happy and grateful, and surely this picture you sketch of a possible old age with you on a farm is most beautiful and satisfying. Who knows what <underline>may</underline> come? _</p>
<p>I have been so deeply upset and worried over Hilda and Alice that Daddy is good enough to let me go to them. I will ride with Sigurd when he leaves here next Sunday for St Louis, after returning with Daddy from Jefferson City where they have an engagement Friday. I cannot feel happy away from them till I can see them in better shape - So I'll be seeing you next week. I hope to sew a lot with you dear, for all of the girls. Have been doing a lot</p>
39
<p>since I returned here for Max and the <unclear/>. Loads of Love to my fine girl and her dearest men</p>
from Mama - Mother
P.S.
<p>It is cold here and we've had the heaviest snow I ever saw in Branson, 5-6 inches fell in one night and remaines on the ground for two days, turning this world into a Paradise.</p>
