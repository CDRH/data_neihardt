Dearest Children:
<p>Just a note to thank you for those gorgeous Cannas - Indeed I'll cherish them, and they will be so beautiful behind our roses. So many thanks to you, dear, Kind children!</p>
<p>They are such strong healthy bulbs and will doubtless grow well.</p>
<p>Tell me <underline>where</underline> you Kept them? I'll never put ours in the cave again.</p>
<p>I have finished 3 garments lately a pair of Pajamas for each Wub and a night gown for their Mama. Then a print dress and pants for baby 'Laine is just finished, now I'm on the second set. After that I'm going to make Max a black jacket like your red one,</p>
100
<p>Enid and your blue one Alice. It will match the black skirt I <sic>mad</sic> Max last year. The lining will me "Ana"rayon - A little felt hat to match also gloves and purse, all aqua! This will be a very attractive outfit for a small price. I want Max to go with the men to Boonville the last of March. Just a short trip and I'll love to keep the Wubs.</p>
<p>Max has been in so close for quite a spell now. After these things I'm going to get at my own clothes which I need desperately to do.</p>
<p>Enid don't you think Alice had better remain with you till after Hildas' early vacation in April or May? If the girls take an apartment Alice must not be alone when Hilda is gone, must she? Please tell me <underline>honestly</underline>.</p>
love as always,
from Mama
Mother.
