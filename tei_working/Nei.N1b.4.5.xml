Dear Mr. Warren:
I have just read your generous letter of August 12, 1972, regarding my work and the Dick Cavett program. I thank you for your kindly remarks. 
Naturally I am interested in the project you have in mind and if I can be of any service to you, I shall be glad. Perhaps you might want to come to my home here for a little talk. If so, you might phone and make an appointment with Mrs. Young, who manages my affairs. 
With all kind thoughts,
John G. Neihardt

The telephone number is 466-9573.
