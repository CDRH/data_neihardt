Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>You see I was 16 when Ollie was born, so I can easily remember his age!! I <underline>did</underline> believe his birthday was in <underline>Aug</underline>! Am so eager to get your curtains etc. They sill "revive" this Home with the cheerfulness of their bright color. Hilda sent me some beautiful cretonee, which I am using for pillows and lampshade. So glad you want us up there. May be we could use your basement to cast our sea nymph in??</p>
Loads of Love to your three
Mama
