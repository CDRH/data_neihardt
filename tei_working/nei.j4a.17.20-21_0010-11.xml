                    <dateline>Apt. 82, 445 Riverside Drive,New York City, July 26,1937</dateline>
                    
                    <salute>Dear John:</salute></opener><p>We agreed at the close of the glorious meeting in Saint Louis that we would write longer letters and more frequently than we had and here I have been run ning about the land for nearly two months and I sent you not one word.</p>
                    
                    <p>Well, here goes. We stopped for a day with the son of Lucy who has a department of ggriculture<sic>agriculture</sic> job at the University of Missouri,and saw him and his two children.His wife,a delightful l<del/><add>it</add>tle woman when she is herself is in a sanitarium,and will probably be there for the reoainder<sic>remainder</sic> of her life. A classmate of mine who was ,until recently, President of Doane College, preaches a sermon on "The Quiet Ways Of God".Is the situation above recorded one of them, a quiet way of destroying happiness for a family?</p>
                    
                    <p>Our train stopped twenty minutes at Topeka and there we saw Darley <hi rend="caps">L.</hi> House,son of my oldest brother who died recently.The son is a fine upstanding chap,and we both love him.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nothing more except travel till we came to Los Angeles,where Mary <add><note type="recipient">Mrs. Morrie Rysbard</note></add> met us <unclear>a</unclear>nd took us to Beverly Hills.Of course we met a lot of notables,whodo<sic>who do</sic> not interest me particularly,but they were a jolly crowd. Mary's children <del>w</del> are <unclear>s</unclear>tunning youngsters. Ruth,six years old,suddenly recited a poem that no one <unclear>o</unclear>f us had ever heard;it was perfect in sense,rhyme,rythm<sic>rhythm</sic>. We asked her where <unclear>s</unclear>he got it and with some pumping learned that she had composed it herself.</p>
                    
                    <p>While there I had a surprise.There was a picnic of the alumni and former <unclear>s</unclear>tudents of Kingfisher College and I was guest of honor.It was amazing the way they shouted for the old days and for me.</p>
                    
                    <p>Then a former student<del>s</del> of Wayne,a fine young woman who teaches at Los <unclear>A</unclear>ngeles,took me to see Hartley Alexander at Scripps College.</p>
                    
                    <p>We went from Beverly Hill to SanFrancisco<sic>San Francisco</sic> and visited a brother of Lucy and <unclear>h</unclear>is family.He has had a hard life and now he and his wife run a boarding <unclear>h</unclear>ouse,and,between gastronomic tasks, he reads Spinoza.</p>
                    
                    <p>On our way from SanFrancisco<sic>San Francisco</sic> we stopped a few minutes at Salt Lake and <add>saw
                    
                    <note type="authorial">A nephew of mine whom I had not seen</note></add>
                        
                    <pb facs="nei.j4a.17.20-21_0011"/>

                        since our war to save the <del>Phillipines</del> Philippines.He is a fine chap.His wife,whom I had never before seen,was with him as were a son and a daughter and a brother-in-law of mine whom I last saw in 1896. He  was husband of a sister who recently died.</p>
                        
                    <p>In Denver we stopped with a brother and his wife,and then to Lincoln,which seems to me like a graveyard since Sam Avery died. While there I had two great thrills,one a visit <del><unclear>fr</unclear></del><add>wi</add>th Dr.Lewis. But the <del><unclear>ma</unclear></del><add>am</add>azin<del><unclear>e</unclear></del><add>g</add> thing was to <del>be</del> receive a telephone call from Jim Brittain with the word that he was drivin<unclear>g</unclear> down to see me.He was with me for a half day and we had a magnificent time talking of Spengler and you. He averred that he owed his life to three men: Alexander,Neihardt and House. I was a bit stunned to <del>me</del><add>be</add> classed with the other two.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are now staying in New York and Lucy is attending a class in writing articles for magazines and I work a bit when I get a chance</p>
                    
                    <p>Now,this is a gossipy letter,and nothing else,but it may serve to get us into tou<unclear><del>g</del><add>c</add></unclear> once more.I need you.</p>
                    
                    <p>Love to all,and an enormous lot to John,the ever fruitfu<unclear>l</unclear> poet from the Poet's Town.</p>
                    
                    <p>Oh,I nearly forgot! The Nebraska folk had a gathering here at Columbia an<unclear>d</unclear> I with others was called upon.I talked about you.</p>
