Dear Mama, 
This is just a short note to let you know how sorry we all are that you are not here. I was really shocked for a mometn when I saw Dad drive up here alone. I just couldn't figure out WHY! We will see you soon. 
Tell Betty "hello" from all of us here! 
Take it easy, Mom. Don't get out in the hot sun too much! 
Please be happy and know how much I love you & think of you (even tho' I don't write enough). 
Endless love, 
Sig & family.
