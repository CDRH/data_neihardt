Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>Thank you for all your patience and courtesy in reciting for our microphone yesterday.</p>
<p>Those tapes will be cherished for our lifetimes, for the subjects of course, but more because you did them for us.</p>
<p>We talked of light. May yours grow brighter, and we hope you will find a return of the one you already have see in Pa Sapa next month.</p>
Cordial regrads,
Ethel and Harold
