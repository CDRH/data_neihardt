Precious Enot:
<p>When we were in the Great Smoky Mountians of North Carolina looking for rubies, I got a chunk of raw amethyst that had been water-rolled in Cowee Creek, where the rubies grow. There was enough for two hearts in it - one for you and one for Mama. I'm sending yours today. It should look well with your amethyst ring, and you can wear it either on a black silk card or on your neck chain that goes with the ivory rose.</p>
<p>You will note it's not a <underline>young</underline> hear I'm sending, but an old one, interiorly scarred, and, I think, beautified by the waters of years.</p>
<p>We also got two rubies - one of about 4 carats and the other aroudn 10 carats when cut! I'm now cutting them, and cannot yet be sure how they will come out with high polish. It's the polish that liberates the life in the stone.</p>
<p>Surprising progress with <underline>Jed Smith</underline> all the while I'm making jewelry - crystal ring &amp; earrings for old Hiddy etc.</p>

<p>The thing develops as though already written somewhere, adn the lines workout almost automatically in patterns of a <unclear/>at simplicity that often amuses me.</p>
Love to you, old Oddie and Alice.
Dad
