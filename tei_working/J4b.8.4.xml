Dear Mamma:
I'm leaving tomorrow, Friday morning for New York, and I hope something may develop though I have no notion what it might be. I wouldn't go if it were only for honors. While there I will seel a number of people I need to see.
Latham wrote me lately saying that Macmillans would keep in mind my suggestion as to going on their staff. He said such a vacancy might occur and I'd certainly hear of it if this should come about. Said they's feel "privileged" to have me with them. This might work out in time. I'd like it, I believe. But I'd like better than anything else to live quietly in Branson and work.
It is curious, isn't it, that this invitation should come from New York so soon after something of the sort was prophesied by the <del/> mediums. I wonder if they really know anythingThe last medium said this is my "banner year", and that led be "ace-high". I hope so for practical reasons. 
Kemma, take care of yourself and watch your bowels. Also, look out for that back step always, especially when it's slippery. 
Endless love, 
Jno. 
Can't very well see Grace with I could. Of possible, I will.
