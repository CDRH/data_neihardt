Dear Mama:
<p>Thanks for your letter just received. I'm so glad that your teeth job is becoming a thing of the past. It's a miserable thing to go through, I know!</p>
<p>I note what you say about hotels. I wont have any difficulty finding one. I had thought of going to Galesburg via a rout North, but that is only a saving of 30 miles. So I'll come to see you folks at Hilda's hotel sometime after supper this Wednesday evening. It will be impossible for me to get away from this business before Wednesday noon. See?</p>
<p>You probably did not know of Dad's and my plans to meet him in Galesburg Thursday night. We decided this best because he does have so much luggage to fool with, and besides - the car is for no other reason than to furnish our transportation.</p>
<p>Confidentially, I have taken out an accident insurance policy which pays $10,000.00 in case of auto accident death. It also pays for hospital and many forms of sickness etc. The Co. is North American Accident Insurance Co., Newark, New Jersey. I thought it foolhardy to be without a policy since this IS A RELIABLE firm and the cost is only $10.50 yearly. $2.50 down, and the $8. balance payable $2. monthly for 4 months. I requested an application for Dad too, so we'll both be covered as is only proper, believe me.</p>
<p>I do want to talk with you and Hilda and Alice Wednesday eve.</p>
Always love from us all,
<signed>Sig, Max &amp; Joan &amp; 'Laine.</signed>
