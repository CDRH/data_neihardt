<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>Golly! I'm sorry I missed you! To think that you were in Columbia, and I was away! But you say you may return in Aug. I hope I'll not miss you then. Some nice things have been happening. I was happy with Alice &amp; the children in Mississippi. Then there's a party wanting an option on <hi rend="underline">When the Tree</hi> etc. - television rights. Also, the state agency of publications in Czechoslovakia wants to publish my <hi rend="underline">Cry of the People</hi> in an anthology of American poetry. The Poetry Society of Texas wants me to be sole judge of its poetry contest. They have real poets down there - more than their proper share, it seems. I've judged several times during the past 20 or 25 years. Found a really great ballad last time. Gave it first and Readers Digest featured it.</p>

	<p>I'm alone in Skyrim. It's beautiful, and <hi rend="underline">so damned lonely</hi>. Mrs. Aly will be here about Aug. 1st. We will make a trip into Nebr. for the biography. This should occupy the first two weeks of the month.</p>
	<p>Affection always for you and Nita.</p>
