Dear Harold Clingerman: 
I was very glad to hear form you for I do not forget your encouraging interest in my work and I am greatly pleased to hear that you liked my latest book, ALL IS BUT A BEGINNING. 
I think it will interest you to know that a special writer for the Saturday Review of the Arts interviewed me a month or so ago for an article which will appear in the Review in February. I am told that advance copies will be available in January. 
You will note that ALL IS BUT A BEGINNING is now a best seller. Also, BLACK ELK SPEAKS continues its good work throughout the country and even a half dozen countries of Europe. It's hard to believe that there are two best sellers at the same time. 
Is it likely that we may meet before too long and have a chat about this and that. 
With every kind thought, your friend
John Neihardt
