                <opener><salute>Dear John -</salute></opener> <p>What a pleasant surprise to have a letter from you! I wish it could have been free from the word of Mona's going as the rest of the letter was as I would have it &#8212; John you know that I feel that you had to be separated for a time from her &#8212; This awful lonliliness<sic>lonliness</sic> is all death can be for us who feel our loved ones have just gone ahead. I would be glad that <add>you</add> could have had more years of the satisfaction and contentment I know you had with her. Yes, we must get together. I know we would be as if some

                    year had not separated us. Can't you come to see me? <unclear>I</unclear> cant go to you for I am partly an invalid &#8212; The doctors say my days of travel are finished. I wonder as I fooled them when they saw nothing but death for me. A year ago last February I became a burden to myself. Hospital here for a time, then July 22nd ('57) I went to a <hi rend="caps">U.S.</hi> Veteran's hospital in Ft. Wayne. It was my heart. I was in bed there 13 1/2 weeks, six of them I was not allowed to sitt<sic>sit</sic> up. To add to my misery I coughed blood for 3 weeks. But as I said above I fooled them and am here

                    <unclear>and am</unclear> living alone. Of course I have help to look after the house etc. There are three bed-rooms at your disposal. Do come! The long in bed <hi rend="underline">wasn't bad</hi>, as I read constantly, from Plato to some light stuff friends sent me. The most remarkable thing I have to relate is I declared my love to a brillant woman (of <hi rend="caps">N.Y.</hi>) &#8212; I did not ask for marriage &#8212; as that is for younger humans. Unfortunately too my beloved is an invalid. If I were to bring up my life to date there would be volumes. Since seeing you I have spent much time in Europe and

                    Africa, Canary Islands, <unclear reason="fold">Spain</unclear> Mallorca (above all else) etc. I was always alone. The auto accident has made me very lame. I still can play (the piano) &amp; thank God my mind is as active as ever. Not being able to go out alone, I sitt<sic>sit</sic> here &amp; read &amp; read &#8212; and think &#8212; I am conscious

                    more than ever of my oneness with God. How fortunate for the youngsters in the University to have the Epic course under you &amp; I still feel I like "the Messiah best" &#8212; Where is the charming daughter, the petite one, who seemed to have inherited your intellect? I have no strength, perhaps to much for this time. Write me.</p>
