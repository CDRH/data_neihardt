<p>Dear Friend:</p>

	<p>My silence does nto mean that I forget you. I think of you very often and am grateful for your friendship. Your brother and I meet quite often and speak of you. The other day he gave me the account of Dean Bailey's death and told me that you were a pall-bearer at the funeral. What a man Bailey was, and what a luminous spirit he must be! His story seems almost incredible. <hi rend="underline">The Holy Earth</hi> alone would have been a great achievement - but, of course it was only one manifestation of a noble life. What a lesson he was for pessimists and cynics- and <hi rend="underline">is</hi>!</p>

	<p>Things go well here. My <hi rend="underline">Epic America</hi> course still thrives, and, altho'<sic>although</sic> the prerequisites are stiff, students crowd in. I'm surprised again each new semester.</p>
	<p>The family is well, and our little girls are growing fast. The baby, "Booboo" insists upon being called Erica, because she is now "big", being in nursery school. She loves her "teeter"!</p>
	<p>I'm enclosing two letters from my friend, James Whitaker of the publishing firm of Andrew Melrose, London. He is an amateur botanist and archaeologist<sic>archeologist</sic>, and, as you will note, he made a great discovery in the Hebrides last summer. You will not also that he has hoped I might find a student here who would be willing and able to share expenses with him next summer when he will go back to work on his discovery. We have not been able to find anyone here, and I'm hoping there might be one at Cornell. Would you mind showing these letters to the proper professors there? The letters are intimate and I hope &amp; believe will be read with friendly eyes. I'd be glad if some enterprising student there should seize a really rare opportunity. The letters are marked so that they may be read in order.

Perhaps your Dept. of Archaeology<sic>Archeology</sic> may want to consider Whitaker's offer.</p>
	<p>Anyway - the best of intentions are mine! May we look forward to a visit from you next summer?</p>
		
			<p>With affectionate thoughts</p>

                        <p>Your friend,</p>
