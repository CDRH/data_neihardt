Dear Daddy and Mama,
<p>I sent you a card this morning saying we were leaving for Mexico in a few hours. A few things have arisen at last moment which are detaining us awhile. There has been a lot of bungling in this whole affair, which none of us could help. Now our hand must be reposted and the Mexican consul must personally receive instructions to let us through (from Mexico City) before we can go</p>

<p>Are expecting call soon from man in Nuevo Laredo who handles such matters. We hope to leave tomorrow. Pray that we are gone when this reaches you. Oh! this war business.</p>
<p>it is a strange, lovely night, with a soft, cool, almost - threatening breeze, a lightly clouded sky, few stars, many bug - noises. Wish you could feel it with us. I've been lying here on the bed dreaming a bit of the Golden Days at Home: how we used to lie out on the porch at night under the glorious star-strewn heavens - you in your hammock, Mama, you on the cot, Daddy, and Hil and I on the floor. I even hear</p>
