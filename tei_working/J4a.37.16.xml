Dear Dr. Neihardt,
Once again we would like to do your one-act play, "800 Rubles," for speech contests and would appreciate your permission to present it. Also, could you tell us the amount of royalty and to whom the check should be sent? None of my catalogs list this play. 
Enjoyed your latest book "All Is But a Beginning" so much, es-pecially the way you met your wife. Also brought back many happy memories of my own childhood.
A belated "Happy Birthday" and "Many Happy Returns."
With warmest wishes,
Caroline Green
