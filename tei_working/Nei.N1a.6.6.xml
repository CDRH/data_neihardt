Dear Friend: 
I have met with the Returned Teachers program committee chairman and others concerned Today, and the subject of the April 3rd meeting was discussed. We are all elated to know you can come, but we do not feel that you should have to bear the transportation expense, which your last letter (Feb. 11) indicated your willingness to do. I'm sure that some means of helping to defray this may be worked out. We appreciate your kindness in all of this matter, and we do not want to impose. 
The Retired Teachers group would like to have your part of the program to begin about 10:30 a.m. Monday April 3rd, and to last 30-45 min-utes, with your own choice of material. This would follow a business session beginning at 10:00 a.m., and would be followed by an informal visiting period before the noon luncheon. You would not need to speak at the luncheon, unless you wished to. The plan is to hold the whole affair in the Georgian Room of the Cornhusker Hotel. The room will easily seat 100, and more could be accomodated. Members and invited guests would have priority. 
Rev. Art Ernst, pastor of our Warren Methodist Church has written to you regarding the April 2nd morning service. No doubt you have received this and will write to him soon, after which he would write again to you. Let me know if you did not get his letter, and he will write you again. Mary Holm said she would write you concerning the Holm manuscript. She has turned over a very interesting file to us, and we look forward to sharing it with you when you come. 
Please let us know how much time you can spend in Lincoln - we have so many things to show and discuss. 
Sincerely
Julius D. Young
