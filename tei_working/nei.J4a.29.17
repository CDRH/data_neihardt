Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Since returning from joining in your birthday celebration, I find myself thinking what a nice occasion it was.</p>
<p>I kow you were surprised and pleased to be with your friends, and certainly I was happy that I was able to be present and share your birthday with you.</p>
<p>Remember, you promised to join me when I celebrate my 80th birthday, and I expect you to keep your agreement.</p>
<p>I want to compliment you on your ability to blow out candles and cut birthday cake, and all in all, make everyone happy to be with you.</p>
<p>Kindest personal regards and sincere wishes for many similar occasions in the future.</p>
Yours very truly,
