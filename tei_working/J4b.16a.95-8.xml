Dear Oddie:
<p>My silence doesn't mean a thing but that I'm silent. I've had a heck of a time to make myself write letters for many years, as Enot knows! When I think of you, it's with gratitude that you're one of us. I know you've helped to steady old Sig and encourage him. When I'm out of these woods, I may have a practical way of remembering yours &amp; Enot's goodness.</p>
<p>I'm getting on with my work. Sig will probably show you a letter from Latham.</p>
Endless love
for both of you.
Dad
<p>What a masterly retreat that was!?!!</p>

<p>we ate a picnic dinner in our pasture and it was fun. Elaine and I catch pollywogs with the strainer and one day Elaine caught a fish -ha! She put it back in.</p>
