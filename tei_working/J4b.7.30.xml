Dear Mama:
[Branson, Mo] 
No, I'm not "disgusted" with your radio troubles. I just want you to have a good time with it, and you will have yet. As for the battery, we'll include the cost of charging in the next check. So that needn't worry you. The trickle charger has been ordered today, to be sent to you from Chicago, and you will have no charging troubles$ after it is installed. It works from the house current. When you get it, have it installed by Fowler upstairs. I'm sorry about the loud speaker. If it was much damaged, you should have put in a claim for damages. The railraod would have paid. But evidently the thing works well. If it works well at any time, it is not harmed. I wish I were there to get you started off right with the outfit. No, so far as I knew, there wasn't any indication of wave lengths on your dial. I didn't examine that to see. Anyway, you can get stations, noting at what number they were gotten, and so make a record of many situations. This is as good as any other way for your purposes. The Atwater Kent is certainly one of the best radios on the market, and I know you'll have great luck with it a little later on, after you have installed the charger. Don't think about your "debt". I'll pay that and you can forget about it at once. 
Lots of love, 
Jno.
