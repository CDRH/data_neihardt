Easter day 
Dearest Daughter of mine: 
You surely did give us a lovely surprise. It arrived Friday afternoon but we kept it un opened until this morning where we were having breakfast at 4 oclock A M - before going out to the Easter Sunrise service on Inspiration Point The Bunny is going to furnish deserts for a long time to come, and we are anticipating opening our interest ing looking eggs with pleasure at dinner today. 
Alice and I hired Mrs

Spurlock to take us and the little crippled girl and her mother out to the Wentful place. Alice saw the entire show and enjoyed it, but the rest of us tried to see as much of it as we coudl which was not so enjoyable but the change was good for all of us, it made me ap-preciate Home more than ever if such a thing can be. I al-ways feel insulted or hurt - or both when I see a man in human body and clothes take the Part of "The Christ" at least he should have had a Halo about him - but it

is fortunate that most people feel otherwise. 
It was a joy to get up and look about our place this morn-ing - It is so clean and grean and lovely! Yesterday we paint-ed all our trees with a protecting paint, made <del>mixture</del> of line and Bordeau-mixture, glue and water - dressing them up in Easter ar-ray! I painted our big gate and it looks nice. I amhoping that it will seem sensible to can a lot of fruit this year I am going to wash all of the jars and have a man water-proof the cellar walls before I put them ^the jars back on substan-tial shelves. What I am do-

14
ing on the place, are the things that will make it last better, and be orderly. It is surprising how much that takes in! Any one will think better of the place for these things being done, they should be done whether we are here or not. 
Richard Greer brought us a Chess game, and I am teaching Alice this game; she is doing nicely on the Violin so that I must look around for a second violin now to accom-pany her. We expect to do the Played Don shortly! 
Alice also is baking very god bread and rolls and cinnamon realls - I am so glad once 

15
your dancing - Please write me more about everything - Loads of Love 
Mama.
P.S. Amama is leaving Europe the 13th of this month. I hope she'll come to see us for a good, long visit.
