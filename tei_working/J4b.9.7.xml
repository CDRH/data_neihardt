Dear Mamma:
[Branson, Mo.]
I think we understand the way you feel better than you realize. All we want for you is what will come nearest to making you reasonably happy, and we do want that very much. Mona is always considering the matter. I'm sure you are lucky to have a beautiful home and to be your own manager. That's a lot, and you show that you realize and appreciate it. Now if we can make some sort of plan to be nearer together, everything will be all right. I'll jog up the circulation department here and see why your paper doesn't reach you as it should. You needn't worry about "surfeiting" us with letters. We want them. I haven't much to say this morning, but everything is going on finely in every way, so far as I can see. 
yes, we want the yard kept mowed. It would be too bad to have it looking bad next to yours. It's practically a part of your place. We'll send extra for that, of course. 
Endless love,
Jno.
Please send the books to <del/> Kirkwood.
