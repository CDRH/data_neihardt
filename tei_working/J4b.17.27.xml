Dear Joan:
<p>What a lovely long letter you wrote me for my birthday! I'll lay it away so that I can read it every once in a while.</p>
<p>How are you getting on with your sewing? Is the thimble <unclear>beeping</unclear> much? How is Shirley's head feeling now?</p>
<p>We need some houses built in our front room. When do you think you could build them for us?</p>
<p>Dr. George says that Miss Muffet is <underline>not</underline> a lady. He says she is just a tom boy. Miss Muffet says why are cats anyway? But they don't fight.</p>
<p>Nanny says <underline>you</underline> are a lady, and so does your loving</p>
Gaki
