Dear Lucile:

	You're back again and so am I. This is just to say hello and how good it was to be with you for a few minutes in Portland. You and I <hi rend="underline">are</hi> drawm together by Fate, and yet are seem to slip past one another!! One of these times perhaps we'll have a real comradely session - maybe over a tall stein of Olympia. I hope so. 
	My visit was good me. I'm really a bit lonely, I can tell you, <unclear> and it was good to be in your home for a few days. Everyone was so good to me - including precious Perky! I <hi rend="underline">have</hi> wondered, since my return, if I was not an intruder, but it was good to be with Charles and Minna, Robin and Barbara. They are dear people. And old Casey! What a boy!
	It was good of you to let me share in getting Perky for old man Stewart! I love that young man, and now I love his doggie too. Good liking ths old man at least a little!

					      Affectionately,
			                    <signature>John</signature>


	Of course, your Lucile was her dear self and very kind.

	The whole family enjoyed the excellent <unclear> on New Year's Day! Many thanks!
