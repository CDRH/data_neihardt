Dearest Eny + Ol;
<p>Thanks so for the telegram, it made me feel swell that you thought of me.</p>
<p>The pKg. arrived today and the gloves are fine so is the hair - net!</p>
<p>I had the swellest birthday. Mom made me a swell date cake + we had Mom Daisy + Dad Melton up + they brought me another cake and a jar of homecanned pickles + a jar of jelly! And the very nicest thing of all was that Dad announced at the dinner table that he was going to dedicate Jed Smith to me, as he said Sig had the first volume of the Cycle and I should have the last - gee, there is just nothing I can say to show my appreciation. I'm so happy about it, for things like that have so much meaning to me.</p>
<p>I must go to bed - you know what a birthday is like with us so here's love in gobs for you and Ollie. Hope to see you in the near future. I'm not going on the booking trip but will go on engagement often.</p>
Love,
Max + Sig + Jean + Elaine
