J.G.N.
FOR ALBERT AND HILDA
(Remembering their garden wedding)
<lg><l>Whatever skies may darken,</l>
<l>One blue-gold noon remains</l>
<l>Forever, hushed to hearken</l>
<l>Between the April rains; </l>
<l>Serene in living glory</l>
<l>With what it hears and heard -</l>
<l>The new-old sacred story,</l>
<l>And one applauding bird.</l>

<l>The hedges still are leaning.</l>
<l>The fountain's tinkle dies</l>
<l>To hear the hush, and meaning</l>
<l>Of what it prophecies;</l>
And two made one shall hear it</l>
<l>As long as life endures:</l>

<l>The good red road of spirit.</l>
<l>The hard black road are yours.</l>
<l>But holy, failing never,</l>
<l>
Their crossing place shall be;</l>
<l>For there shall spring forever</l>
<l>
And soar the shielding Tree</l>
<l>A
nd when two hearts thereunder</l>
<l>Recall the plighted words,</l>
<l>The Tree sall bloom with wonder</l>
<l>And will with singing birds.</l></lg>
