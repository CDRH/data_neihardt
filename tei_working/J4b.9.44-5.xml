My Dear girl - 
I am writing a hasty letter this morning; Just to say you will soon see John and Enid and Hilda, - dear Miss Piper you will be surprised to see your Hilda nearly grown, she is such a retiring reticent child Her daddy's on and you will understand her, I am saying this because you will have to meet her more than halfway - they are delighted that they are to see you and I can hardly contain myself.- I am still holding on to the thot that maybe you will come to see us this summer. I will surely write you a decent letter a little <unclear/> but dont wait just write and tell me you are coming. 
I love you always, 
a.m. Neihardt

P.S.-
If you have not already heard about John being in Wayne 7th Comms will tell you the particulars
