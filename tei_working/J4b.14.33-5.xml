Enright Ave., Friday Evening
Dear Girl: 
Your first (Wed.) letter and Sig's arrived at 3:30 today. I had begun to wonder, but I understand. At four yesterday the dentist pulled two, and couldn't, somehow, make them dead. I told him not to put any more dope in, but to get it over. He hurt grandan ^plenty sure enough; but I was almost glad for the pain, which stopped at once & didn't come back. But somehow, altho' I felt all right, I didn't sleep all night. Just wasn't sleepy, and so, logically enough, I stayed awake till dawn, & then dozed a few weeks. He'll pull the rest at 6:30 this evening, and at the same time sock the denture in place. It'll be all right of course. (over)

nice about the ladies coming to look! I'll say the saw some damned nice people I love with all my in'ards! 
Nothing doing here but waiting for appointments 24 hours apart. Tell Madame Joan, The Beautician, that Grandan's hair needs sixing something awful And says all lovely things to Elaine Kiss both of them. I'm glad for the way you, Sig, are pushing the Business. We'll land soem, certainly., 
Fine you're getting on so well with the figure, Mona. I'll enjoy helping cast & place it. 
And what a fine letter it was. That Old Lady Max didn't write! 
Love to all of you 
Jno Dad
