Dearest Husband
Am all in - but when you receive this I'll be O.K. nice move - 
Have taken Colonel and the last bail is about to climax - Also my good eye is pastural shirt with a wad, to keep me from straining it, as it has a "stye" on it - 
But I did want to thank you for the marvelous 20 Bucks. They are always a Godsend - and am so grateful once more to teh <unclear/> Man in the World - 
PLease do not work so hard!
