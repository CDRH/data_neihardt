<p>Dear Mrs. Aly:</p>

	<p>I'm at the office. Want to tell you about John Chaffee. He was not my companion on the trip down the Missouri in 1908. He came 10 years earlier. John had a stroke after his wife died last August, and his sister, Edna, writes his letters: Edna has an invalid husband, and I'm sure the situation is a bit saddening. John is looking forward to seeing you &amp; Dr. Aly.

My boy companion on the trip down in 1908 was Chet Marshal, dead long ago. I hope you can cheer John up. His wife's death seems to have broken him.</p>

	<p>Did I tell you I'm going to Cornell again in May?</p>
