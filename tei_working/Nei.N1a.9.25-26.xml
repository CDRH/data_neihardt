My dear Dr. Neihardt: 
Mrs. Lois Hegstrom tells me that you have consented to attend the Phi Delta Gamma Convention luncheon Saturday, June 27th, 12:15 p.m., at the Kellogg Center and that you will address us briefly at that time. 
Will you kindly choose a topic and send me the title so that we may send it, with other information, to the printer. Our chapter, Pi, at Creighton University, is in charge of details for the Saturday noon event. 
We shall look forward with great pleasure to meeting you next month in Lincoln. 
Sincerely yours, 
Mary Alice Engles
