Sweetheart, 
I am missing you so! It's beyond words for me to try to ex-press my feelings a-bout this being away from my dear girl so long!
I looked at the moon last nite (Thurs.) at 8:55-9:00!

the effects of riding ten days - we'll stroll up & down the river bank this P.M.! 
I must say - my sweet girl - that I am ab-solutely sure, I love you; ^please dn't even in the least way - think that anything in regard to this will change! It can't, because I am so happy & feel so lucky to have such an un-usual fine girl to love! 
My love for you

is constant, & will always be that way! It makes me feel like a new person in every way - to re-ceieve a letter from my sweetheart!
Please, honey, let me know ahead of time where I can find you when I get home! 
Gee! It will be wonderful to get together again in person! Must close, dear; & I'll get your "Peru" letter as soon as the Pres. Pate gets back from lunch! Hope so at least!! 
Always I love you, 
Sig
