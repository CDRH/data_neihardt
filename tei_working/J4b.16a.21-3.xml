Dear Enot Penot:
<p>I've stopped a few mintues to say hello. You have said several times that you want to copy <underline>Jed</underline> for me when it's ready. That should be in September, and I'd like to arrange to go up there with Mama. And have you do the manuscript. I <underline>do</underline> want you to do it. I'm very happy over the way it develops - surprised nearly every day. The terrain all across the Sierras during 8 days of travel is meticulously, altho rapidly, presented, and and I don't know where the details come from. When I start out on the trip in the morning, I see clearly ahead as though I were doing the travelling, &amp; never have to figure out how it might be, I'm wondering if I'm really describing the route (which is unrecorded) just as I did in The <unclear/> of Glass. Maybe I'll have the opportunity to go through the Sierras &amp; see. I know within 30 miles where to head in, &amp; I could identify the opening canyon, <underline>if</underline> I am actually describing. I have two queer things to tell you.</p>

<p>It's been bully to have poor old lady Hiddy here. She leaves tomorrow, Sunday A.M.</p>
<p>Glad you like the heart. Perhaps I can find amethyst on the next trip for those earrings, Mama's new crysstal ring is rather lovely.</p>
Love to you &amp; to Oddie and old Lady Alice,
Dad.
<p>I made Mama a beautiful amethyst heart, slightly larger than yours. Haven't bored the fastening hole yet - no diamond dust for the tube drill.</p>
