Dear John,
<p>We sure do got fun!!!! The news from you is so exciting I'm not sure I touch ground when I read your letters and Myrtle's. You must all of you by spinning faster than celestial tops on the summit of shining mountains. I'm delighted, of course, and <underline>not surprised</underline>, at Dick Cavett's response to you; why should he be different from anyone else? I didn't see the Arthure Godfrey program because we can't get the show on the night it appeared; we've got a conflict of stations on one ABC channel and a mania for local basketball on the other. But I am watching every possible show for mentions of you. I would miss the one that <underline>did</underline> mention you! I should say that I have the entire English department and assorted historians, friends, casual passers-by, and general public alerted to the coming of the best show on TV in many a year  You will have an audience out here, all right; I'm now scouting my friends for the ones with the best color set--our two sets are black and white only.</p>
<p>Tell me more about the Knopf plans about you; you said something about the possibility that they would take over the hardback rights. Who do you deal with at Knopf? I am excited about that, too; to get those books all back in print in good editions would be great. If they do the <underline>Cycle</underline>, would they replate it in consistent type? You must keep me up to date on the happenings. When I get to the next books, I'll need all this. You live up enough to fill a ten-volume set. On second thought, make it twenty.</p>
<p>This letter is a little late--I've been in bed with a throat infection that I couldn't seem to throw off. It is gone now except for a nose-ear fuzzy feeling, and I missed a day of school, but I'm navigating again. I do want you to know, however, that I have begun the rework on the manuscript and will be able to work pretty steadily. It isn't a momumental job, really; I find that I can delete phrases and some sentences without taking out chunks, and it shortens quite a bit. Fewer adjectives are generally better anyway.</p>
<p>Love to everybody, especially yourself, and keep me up to date  That takes some doing, the way you live. WE are thinking about you.</p>
