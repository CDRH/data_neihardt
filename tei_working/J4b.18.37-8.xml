Hilda Darling:
<p>Your wedding is the great event ahead now and every thing we do is with reference to <underline>it</underline>! Bless you dear heart and Alberts'.</p>
<p>You will love original gifts for your bridesmains! I have now finished the model and turned it over to Daddy for making the rubber mold etc.</p>
<p>Yes Hilda I'll love to make the veil if you'll get material. I am so glad about the long dresses. One's wedding should be as beautiful as one can possibly have it, and as</p>

<p>meaningful as well.</p>
<p>You need not send records, just bring them. Have you thought too about the proper baggage for your Honeymoon? I mean have you a suitcase and trunk, or what? Please Hilda bring the 2 cots down the next time a car comes - because we'll <underline>need</underline> them. Daddy and I are going to sleep on them out in the big tent. -Did you write Mr and Mrs Plank to remain at our house, and can Albert sleep down town?</p>
<p>So many questions!</p>
<p>We had a full moon last night so the frost did not Kill the many buds - I believe it will warm up now -</p>
Devotedly,
Mutti.
