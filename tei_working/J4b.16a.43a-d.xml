Dearest Mama:
<p>We arrived here Friday, received your letter, also Piano monthly statement. I just sent the piano payment. Hope you didn't send it <underline>also</underline>. I had no notion that you were mailing their statemetn to me. I hope my asking you to send that payment has not caused a confusion. Perhaps it <sic>has'n't</sic>. We are through with the hardest part of our trip now. Really,</p>

<p>it has been far from easy. I am very happy over the way Dad has felt on this trip.</p>
<p>We are today at Krieder's. In September he will return via Branson from a California trip he plans to take soon. That was a shame about Judge Vinsonhaler dropping in for so short a visit. Surely <sic>tho'</sic> -- if her really were aware - Dad &amp; all of us feel kindly as ever to him. This trip has kept Dad &amp; me very closely</p>

<p>occupied. Surprising, but true, there has been a reason why Dad could not write. Each engagement of course had extra functions for him to take part in.</p>
<p>As for a job or connection of some sort, of course I am on the alert about that. I do think, however, that it would be a mistake for us to "Rock the Boat" too soon. At least one more attempt <underline>must</underline> be made on the landing of engagements for summer &amp; this fall.</p>

<p>Dad is going to make Macmillan take a bit of financial load from our shoulders. At least for the time being while matter either shape - up better - or <underline>I</underline> get squared away in some way that can help.</p>
<p>If I were you I would not worry. take it <underline>easier</underline>, because as far as the 'situation' is concerned Dad &amp; I are both wide awake about it all.</p>
<p>Must stop for now. We're leaving for Chicago.</p>
Endless love for you &amp; the kids,
Sig, Max, &amp; Dad.
