Enid Darling:
<p>Your good letter in which you say that I can really help you makes me eager to come. I miss all of you and I think it very foolish for no to be down here after the need for being here no longer exists. I will finish Dad's bust, and Daddy says he will soon be over the hilltop on Jed, after which he can work in your basement as well as here. So now for the planning about what we should send. I believe it might be a real saving to you and to the Kids if I sent our washing machine to you. Please tell me the truth about how you feel. I could do the washing for everyone so easily excep</p>

<p>ting Ollies' and Sig's shirts, which Id not attempt. Then I could bake for both houses as well - providing you approve - so please tell me the facts. I'll do whatever you say. Then I'll bring 2 pillows and a mattress and bedding. Daddy will bring the outfit for Ollies workshop and the wood for the <unclear>lep</unclear> - or whatever that was he spoke of. Also we'll bring the hedge cuttings and the Wistaria. What else?</p>
<p>I'll love to sew and help you in every possible way - and I want you to <underline>promise me</underline> that you will not do any lifting or moving of furniture in preparation for our coming, which should be the end of January I think. Also <underline>please be careful</underline> on those cellar stairs - you really <underline>should not</underline> go down them at all - nor the outdoor steps either. I have a horror of them for you now. They do not bother me or any one else. But you should avoid them and you can.</p>
Loads of Love
