Dear Lucile:

	<p>It's a long, long while between times but I have something good to tell you, and so I'll not want to tell it. Yesterday I had my last class in Epic America. It was a 2-hour period and I filled it with  <hi rend="underline">The Song of the Messiah</hi>. When I finished, the <hi rend="underline">whole audience exploded in applause simultaneously</hi>, and they kept it up until I stopped them. I could see

the whole audience (176) and every person was applauding. Afterward many came up and said appreciative things One man said: "It has been an honor, sir, to be in your class." Many said similar things. I'm always surprised at such responses; 
<hi rend="underline">very much so</hi>. Those youngsters had sat through a whole semester of the

-3-

<hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>, and I felt they were entitled to feel at least mildly bored during the final period, for which no credit was given.</p> 
	<p>Lucile, I do hope you are all well and that nothing is wrong. Surely I know of nothing wrong, and you are all dear to me as ever. It's a joy to have Alice and the precious girls at Skyrim

The place is very much alive now; and beautiful horses go ramping around the ring as before Nanny left us. I <hi rend="underline">wish</hi> you &amp; Bower and old Stewart could see our horses now! It's a lovely bunch, surely. Bourbon Stonewall, the American Saddle Horse stallion, is too beautiful for words. And the mares and fillies!!!

I've wondered if my remark about you<sic>your</sic> English chairman could have been misunderstood. I meant nothing disparaging about him (I don't know him), merely meant that if he, as so many others, is sold on the modernistic so-called poetry, he could <hi rend="underline">not</hi> care for the Cycle. But he may well be immune to the disease.

You know Tom Harris - <hi rend="underline">assistant to</hi> the Dean? Well, he has been appointed 
<hi rend="underline">Assistant Dean</hi>, and it's a good thing. He really knows his stuff and is very efficient. Seven or eight years ago he was a student of mine. It makes me happy when someone, anyone, wins through merit.
	The other day when I congratulated Harris,

-7-

he told me he had been reading a mystery novel recently, and one of the characters asked another what the answer was "<hi rend="underline">Neihardt's Cycle of the West</hi>!" There was a paragraph of comment. Harris forgot the title of the book, but he'll tell me. I'd like to see the reference. How <hi rend="underline">are</hi> you? Are you fairly free from the allergy

-8-

trouble? I do hope so. Tell Old Man Stewart that Robin lost his doggie; but he has earned $15 from his Gaki, and soon he'll be buying another hairy bundle of affection and goodness. And, Perky! Sweet thing! Pet her for me. And here is some more of the old affection. Please pass it around, and help all you care for.<p>
