Dear Enot:
Your fine long letter - such a dear one!- Came after I mailed mine. This is to be just a note to say that I think it better for me to write Sealock. So don't write him, and I will today, 
Endless love 
Dad 
I've gone over your latest copy of the Messiah. It's beautifully done & with surprisingly few errors. Latham seems determined to visit me here. He says, too, that he will get in touch with you - wants to know you.
