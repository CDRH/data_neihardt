                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Thank you for your letter telling about your trip to Oregon. I went through Portland after my trip to Glacier Park last summer, and came home on the City of Portland Domeliner of the Union Pacific. I have read<del>y</del> many books on the Oregon Trail, and wrote a piece for <hi rend="caps">THE INSTRUCTOR</hi> which they will print soon, I hope. I never get tired of Western history although sometimes I will take an interest in a subject and then read myself out on the subject, but not so with Western History.</p>
                
                <p>I hope you did like the <hi rend="caps">ELEMENTARY ENGLISH</hi> number. Dr. DeBoer sent me a <del>a</del><add>c</add>arbon of the letter he wrote to you. I have never met<del>,</del> him, but I do admire the kind of letters he writes. He has given me all the encouragement I have had to keep writing the column. Right now, I should be getting them ready for next year.</p>
                
                <p>I wrote MacKinley Kantor and asked h<del>e</del><add>i</add>m to write a few paragraphs on the tea<del>a</del><add>c</add>hing of English, but he said he couldn't write 3 sentences right now, as he is preparing to leave for Europe to write a novel about pioneer Iowa. He went to North High with me in Des Moines back in 1918. He was expelled I believe for not conforming with Study Hall rules, ect. Both Drake and Grinnell have given him honorary degrees. He said to ask him again two years from now and he would do it for me. I expect he will spend about two years on his new book.</p>
                
                <p>Did you see this piece about Betjeman, the poet who likes bells so well? I should like to read his Collected Poems.</p>
                
                <p>Did I tell you that last fall I read <hi rend="caps">RED CLOUD</hi> to my mother and she was so happy over it. She said, "That's the best book we've had in the house for a long time." Mother can appreciate good literature, but now she has grown too deaf to be read to, so that is <del>that</del> the last long poem she has heard.</p>
                
                <p>Last week Mary Gunnett from Stuart whom you knew at Fairmont came to Des Moines and had lunch with me but she was caught in our last blizzard and stayed up all night in the big auditorium where they were having a basketball tournament. She planned to retire this June, but her principal won't hear of it.</p>
                
                <p>If you have any good ideas for my column, please pass them along. I know you are a wonderful teacher as well as writer.</p>
