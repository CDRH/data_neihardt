Dearest One: 
Just heard that the "Friends of America Writers" Society has awarded me Honors and $100 for The Messiah. I'm asked ot be in Chicago Apr. 15 & receive the award, of possible. But I get the honor & money any way! 
Also, I've just heard from Radio Station WBnX in New York, asking me to read my poetry there, or indicate what I want read. 
I do love you, dearest one. I know this si not what Mrs. Boyles saw. There's more. 
It's for late April or early way. 
Jno, Dad
