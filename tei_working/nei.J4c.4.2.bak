Dear Sterling: -

	Here's my revised schedule: Arrive Palo Alto Feb 24th. Go to Carmel morning of the 27th, which is Wednesday. Stay at Carmel until Friday evening or Saturday morning. "Do" San Francisco Saturday & Sunday. (I want to hang around the ships, & invade some second-hand bookstores with you, if you'll play Vergil for me in those fearsome regions.) Go to Berkeley Sunday evening. Go to San Francisco Tuesday morning. Take boat for Seattle Tuesday at 1 P. M. <sic>p. m.</sic>
	Or, since Monterey is near Carmel (a recent discovery of mine!) perhaps you & I could meet at Monterey Saturday, Feb 2. Drop me a line at 718 Webster St., Palo Alto, saying which plan suits you.

	Yours always
