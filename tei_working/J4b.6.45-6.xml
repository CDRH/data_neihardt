Thursday morning
Dearest Ones:-
I got here at 8:15 this morning. Slept quite some, but not enough. Will leave here in an hour for Trenton. There I can sleep all afternoon. Tonight I'll change cars three times often 2 a.m. Tomorrow night I'll reach Omaha a little after midnight & go up to Sioux City Saturday morning. Then I'll run back to Lincoln Sunday & see the folks Jones of the Journal will have a dinner for we at the Country Club Monday next, but I'm to do nothing but smile & eat or not as I like: Then Tuesday a.m. at 5, I catch a train for Mammoth I'll. 
I'm not very tired yet & am well. Can rest at Uncle Chas' house.

I do hope you are all well & happy,
a light snow here last night. Tell the wubs that here Daddy can stand facing north & it will be 9 o'clock for the right foot and eight o'clock for the left foot! Half of you eats breakfast an hour before the other half does, & that way you get two breakfasts at the price of one!! From Soo City I may be able to send the music Mona wants. Have her write one there what I shall get if "Dreamy Moment" isn't available I sent soo City address the other day will mail another sketch tomorrow - maybe two - $75 each may do that & draw a small check for expenses. 
Lots of love,
Jno
