Dearest Girls: 
Thanksgiving for a nice birthday, as Joan says when she puts a rock on the altar of the thunder Bein's in our pasture! I'll wear the handkerchiefs conspicuously when I do public stunts. And the garnet is precious as a symbol. Thanks for your being alive! 
"Jed Smith" rolls on at a steady rate of from 10 to 14 lives a day, in spite of the old solar plexus difficulty. It's <del/> very different from the other narratives. Queer that I shoiiuld be finishing strong after 26 years of it! This one ranges in mood from the <unclear/> of common kidding to the highest poetry. 
We're delighted to know that your teacher says you will be ready for public stunts in a year, Hiddy! The three of us will have great fun, and I'll do only lyrics, taking only my third of the time. I'll enjoy that!

We go right on believing profoundly in your future, Alice. You'll land sure enough. 
Endless love, 
Dad
