Precious Mona:
<p>It was bully to receive your letters. Have just read teh one about the electric light-pole &amp; the Mrs. Graves party.</p>
<p>The time at Montgomery was profitable, <sic>altho'</sic> we got $24 only. I expected no <underline>more</underline> than $25. I talked 2 1/2 hrs to classes &amp; the night affair was bully all around. One of the leading professors at the College said before we came "If he knew how bad we need him, he'd pay us for the privilege to come." The talk this morning at the University here was thorougly successful. The same sort of thing that happens other places. Fine auditorium here - early to speak in &amp; fine for playing. We'll drive after the program &amp; <unclear/> &amp; try to make 175 miles before going to bed. I'll probably snooze in the back seat. Max has been having a happy time, &amp; it's fine to have her along.</p>
<p>Had a bully time at Ollie's &amp; Enid's. had a long talk with Alice, &amp; Hiddy was there too. Tomorrow at 11 in the morning is the <strike/> next program - 200</p>
(over)
35
<p>miles form here. But we'll make it well enough.</p>
<p>Not much to say except that I love you. Kisses for Laine &amp; Joan.</p>
Jno.
