<p>Dear Mr. Braithwaite: -</p>

	<p>I have a letter from our friend, Mr. Ledoux, in which he refers to some suggestion of yours regarding the possibility of making moving pictures out of the "Friends" and "Hugh Glass".</p>
	<p>I am writing this note to assure you that any suggestion coming from you would find me hospitable.</p>

	<p>With all kind thoughts,</p>

		<p>Yours,</p>
