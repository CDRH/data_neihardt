<p>Dear Friends:</p>

	<p>I've just received the copy of your McCurdy letter. Since H. S. Latham left Macmillans about two years ago I have had no close contact with anyone in the company. There have been two or three successors to Latham. The present Editor-in-Chief is R. F. De Wilton. I've had some contact with him, but he means nothing much to me. On the off chance that he may prove

helpful, I'm enclosing a note of introduction.

	1. Letters to Latham over many years
	2. Letters to his predecessor as Ed.-in-Chief, whose name I have forgotten.

These would be of general value. Do see Herman Hagedorm at the old Theo. Roosevelt house. He, I'm sure, could help you with introductions.</p>

			<p>Good hunting!</p>

			<p>Affectionately</p>
