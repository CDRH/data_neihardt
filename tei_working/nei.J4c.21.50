<p>Dear Mrs. Aly:</p>

	<p>Look in library for <hi rend="underline">The Young Idea</hi> by Morris (Duffield &amp; Co., N. Y. 1917). In this I was ranked with Robinson and others as a traditionalist. It's a <hi rend="underline">tug</hi> needing comment. My insistence <hi rend="underline">was</hi> and <hi rend="underline">is</hi> on the fact that we are what we are because of what men have thought, felt &amp; done from the beginning; that our roots are in the past. Literature, as life itself, is organic. Creative continuation is the thing! <hi rend="underline">Not imitation</hi>!</p>
