Dear Mr. Neihardt: 
Enclosed are two pictures taken at Stuhr Museum after the play "800 Rubles". 
Would there be any possibility of your coming out to the Halsey National Forest, Halsey, Nebraska on either May 26 p.m., 27 or 28 a.m.? 
The District IV County Superintendents Association has a meeting there on these days and we are look-ing for program material. 
If you could come what would the fee be? 
Sincerely yours, 
Eldon Cunningham
