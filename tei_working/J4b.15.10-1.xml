Dear Enat and Ollie: 
The ties are exquisite, and I'll wear them for public stunts. I'm especially fond of really fine ties - they make such a difference in dress; and these are as beautiful ones as I ever saw. Bully job of work! 
"Jed" hasn't let up yet - 10 to 14 lines daily without a break since you were here. Strange that I should be finishing strong after 26 years! I work with a kind of joyousness most of the time., altho' my solar plexus kicks up as usual. 
Endless love for both of you
Dad
