Dear Dr. Neihardt:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! I wish I could personally extend these greetings. 
You have been so active in community and State affairs, and your fellow Nebraskans are very proud of you. A few things come immediately to mind: First, you are Nebraska's Poet Laureate -- and your Study has been entered into the National Register of Historic Places -- also, you were honored at a statewide Neihardt Day observance last August 2 in Bancroft at, appropriately, the Sioux Prayer Garden and Study which was restored by the Neihardt Foundation -- and much more. We are indebted ot you for so many reasons. 
Please accept my very best wishes on your 90th birthday. Have a wonderful day! 
Sincerely yours,
Carl T. Curtis
