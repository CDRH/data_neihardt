On post cards a person can't say hat they want to! Isn't it true? 
Wednesday Nite Springfield Mo.
My sweetheart--
I'm awfully crowded for time, but just couldn't bear it to not drop you a few lines from here! Oh, please remember how endlessly I love you, & that it will always be this way! 
I love you more all the time!
Well, my dear, sweet girl a few words is better than nothing, at least! So I feel happy to have found even a few minutes in which to send you my love & appreciation

for your goodness! I am so terribly lovesick for you! 
Please take care of yourself! 
No doubt we're both wishing for Nov. 1st to come along!
I got along very successfully in Springfield! 
I bet it was 'cause my sweety held her thumbs! 
Be happy & of course know that I love no girl but you! 
I'm being careful & all is well! 
Endless Love, 
Your Sig.
