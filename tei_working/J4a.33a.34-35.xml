Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>It was so good to hear from you and to know that the book goes well.</p>
<p>I have been thinking of you much lately as I have been reading a book about Jack London wherein much is said of George Sterling. I think I remeber your talking about him and I am wondering if you knew Jack London too.</p>
<p>When I got London's book <underline>Martin Eden</underline> to read, I opened it and on the front sheet were four lines from your "Let me Live out my Life" and he hadn't given you credit for the lines. He must have known your work well to have picked it out for his epigram for the book.</p>
<p>The book, <underline>Martin Eden</underline>, is so far from your philosophy though that there is no comparison. Martin Eden dies a suicide because life has no flavor.</p>
<p>I noticed in last Sunday's paper that Tom Allan had several paragraphs about you and your recalcitrant student who always saw the bad side of life. Did you notice it? It was in the <underline>World Herald</underline>. On second thought I'll send the clipping and in case you already have one, you'll have an extra.</p>
<p>Bill and Jan will be home for Christmas and we have much for which to be thankful.</p>
<p>May you have a wonderful holiday season.</p>
Affectionately,
<signed>Mildred</signed>
