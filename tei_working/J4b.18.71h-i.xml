Dearest Mutti!
<p>Max and Sig have left, the girls are nto yet down, although I hear them talking.</p>
<p>We have been thinking about you so much, wondering how you can manage everything there. I do hope it is not too hard for you.</p>
<p>I am going to write your long letter today, as soon as it is late enough to phone and find our the headquaters of the company. Yes, I'll see that the lamp gets off.</p>

<p>I have been practicing as much as possible each day on the piano and my vocalizes. I am really doing much better in my singing, and I trust I'll do myself justice Wednesday evening. Naturally I don't want to do poorly, even at a <underline>small</underline> recital!</p>
<p>This afternoon I'm going to a shower for Louise, at her sister's (Rose's) apartment. She is marrying the fellow you met --</p>
<p>Thursday was our second mensiversary, and Albert surprised me with a lovely bunch of red roses!</p>
<p>We are all well - and we trust you are also.</p>
Endless love as ever,
Hilda
<p>Alice's white shoes are down there. Perhaps you have already sent them to her at 1355 N. Dearborn, Chicago?</p>

<p>Elaine has on her overalls this morning and looks so cute in them. I think Joanie is putting on her's too.</p>
