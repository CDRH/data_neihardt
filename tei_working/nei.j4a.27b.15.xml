                    <salute>Dear Doctor Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>It is over two months since my sister, Mildred Bennett and I spent that memorable day with you at Skyrim Ranch. Every day since them I have thought of you and the things we talked about that day.</p>
                
                <p>Seven years ago I first read your <hi rend="caps">CYCLE OF THE WEST</hi> and at that time I told my sister that of all American poets--past or present--I would like best to meet you. She promised me then that if I was ever able to spend a few days with her we would make the trip down into Missouri to visit you.</p>
                
                <p>Most of the pleasures of this life are greater in anticipation than in realization, but this was not so. The day spent with you was a pinnacle by which I shall measure heights all the rest of my days. Not only did I penetrate to a deeper understanding of the po<del>r</del><add>e</add>try I have cherished so long, but there was a contact made that day with the glo<del/><add>w</add>ing heart of things--the core of a spiritual vitality that lies at the center of all that is good and all that is growing.</p>
                
                <p>I have two copies of your <hi rend="caps">CYCLE OF THE WEST</hi> and I have circulate<sic>circulated</sic> it among my students ever since I took up teaching. Now I have just gotten <hi rend="caps">WHEN THE TREE FLOWERED</hi> and i<del>j</del><add>n</add> it is Black Elk's prayer, which I love so much. Am trying to get <hi rend="underline">Black Elk Speaks</hi>, but have so far been unable to locate a copy. I have several book stores searching for it.</p>
                
                <p>By this time you must have returned from your summer trip. I look forward with anticipat<del>o</del><add>i</add>on to the publication of the book presenting your life and work, and I particularly long for the time when your critical essays will be collected and available.</p>
                
                <p>The illuminated Easter poem is here before me. Mildred was kind enough to allow me to copy it for her and take the original. Also I have received from her a few colored snapshots taken on the day when we were with you. These, I have set among my treasures.</p>
                
                <p>There are no words adequate to express my gratitude for the day you set aside for us and the blessings you conveyed to us then. I know more certainly than ever before that the shining thing y<del>l</del><add>o</add>u carry-- the reality that transcends life and death and all human experience-- is for all of us.</p>
