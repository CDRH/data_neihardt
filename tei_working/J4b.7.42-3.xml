Dear Mama: 
Had a wonderful reception here last night. The crowd came from up & down the valley - some as far as 40 miles. Perfect attention and they would have listened an hour longer, the whole crowd stayed to shake hands. One professor said that only a band concert had ever held the people like that. 
I'll go on from here to Washington D. C. & then to Boston <unclear/> new york. Will write you from Boston. 
This is a beautiful country - like Branson, except that the hills are higher & steepes. 
The Houses asked all about you & seemed really glad to hear. 
Today I had dinner (at noon) away out on Paint Creek in the mountains. Rode four hours on the banks of the Ohrs yesterday on the way here from Cincinnati Washington D.C. is only 400 miles from here.

you must remember the Coal War of West Va. 10 years ago, when Mother Love, was sent to fusion. Paint Creek is where that happened. Not much to say now, but I'll write again. 
I love you always, Mamma. 
John.
