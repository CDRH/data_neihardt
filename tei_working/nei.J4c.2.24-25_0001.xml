Dear Sterling:

I have been thinking much about you, and from time to time have read in the new volume. Haw are things with you? Are you longing for Carmel? And when you cross the continent will drop in here again? I hope so. Wish me <unclear> take a hike together.
    
It's late at night - for me - and I've been reading, just came on a front <unclear> portrait of Lamb, + it suggests you so much that you sound in the room. So I'm saying "Hello!". I've got you now - front <unclear> like lamb; side <unclear> sounding. Like Algermon Charles. There's a combination! Eh? (A musician once told me that I am a cross between a horse + a leopard!)
