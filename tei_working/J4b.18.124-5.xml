<underline>Today</underline>
Dear Ollie, Enot &amp; Nei:
<p>Many thanks for the good long newsy letter and for the questionaire. I've returned the latter in which I held out for a job as major General. It's good to hear about the garden and its yield - also Enot Penot's canning frenzy. It's a fine feelign to know that the winter supply is increasing. Also, its smart to put stuff away. There would have been no point in trying for a garden after I arrived here. The drouth started 10 days before my arrival, and it would have been funny to plant new beans. There was a home-coming shower,</p>

<p>as usual, and one other nice litte token rain, but otherwise the days are burning hot and the ground is bone-dry. There will most likely be at least a token rain before Saturday.</p>
<p>But, golly, what divine weather, with the feel of eternity about it! I do love these stretches of burning-dry, golden, quiet weather!</p>
<p>Gaki thinks &amp; thinks &amp; thinks about old Nei!! I betcha he's such a good boy! that shinning face, dog on it! Golly, golly!</p>
Endless love to each of you and to all Three-in-One!
