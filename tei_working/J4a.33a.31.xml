Lincoln, Nb.

Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Thank you very much for participating in our Vision-17 1969 Annual Membership Assembly. I believe that Black Elk's Prayer was a significant invocation. Your presentation of it makes me wonder how I ever had the courage to think of doing it myself. It was just beautiful and we appreciated it very much.</p>
Sincerely,
VISION-17, INC.
