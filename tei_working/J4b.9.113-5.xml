Dear Enat:
Right on the job, as usual, weren't you? The letters arrived yesterday, & your good letter with them. This is only by way of showy that I was good to hear from you. There isn't much to tell that would be of interest there. Crowds do the same thing I've come to expect: Lindenwood was perhaps a bit more pleasing. Fine crowd, and a fine institution. A group of students came over from Harri Teachers College, St. Louis, and another from <unclear/> College to hear me.

I do hope you received my letter mailed in St. Louis with Johnson, Inc. stationary, and that you have deposited $100 & sent the little as I instructed. I know well that if you rec'd the letter, the rest is certainly done! You will, of course, keep this for a surprise. 
Tell Hiddy & Alice hello T many kisses!! 
Gosh, if Mrs. Bayleo sees anything like the truth of what will be we are in for a heavy rain of money as a result of Black Elk Speaks! I got something for you too - I mena you personally-
