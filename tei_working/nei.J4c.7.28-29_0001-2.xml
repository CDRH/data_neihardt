Dear Sterling:-

A bully long letter from you, which I shall answer soon. Just now I have time only to say that I'm sending a chat to you and that you needn't spend much time on him. He's a hero-worshipper + wants a look at you. Don't scare him, and don't regard him as a minister <unclear></unclear> (!) from me - that is, as to my views of things. I like him, however. Be a nice purring lion + give him a live memory, Old Scout!

Always yours,

John

Got a hell of a sore finger + can scarcely scribble. (Bully swimming + <unclear></unclear> here - love of a place!)
