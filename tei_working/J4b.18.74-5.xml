Precious Mona &amp; Amama:
(also Doc!)
<p>Just arrived from Kirksville Will run down to Hannibal (20 mi) &amp; there catch a Wabash train direct to Lafayette. Otherwise, I'd have to return to St. Louis &amp; go from there via Indianapolis. This is a very good way to go. I'll play around here tomorrow awhile &amp; look at pawn shops!</p>
<p>Perfectly bully time at Kirksville! Large crowd, <underline>mostly</underline> women teachers in for summer school. <unclear/> than The Messiah, &amp; they were held perfectly for 50 minutes. I was in good shape. At 1 o'clock I took a class for an hour - several classes in one; and it was one of those <underline>good events</underline>.</p>

<p>They were such fine young people, &amp; <underline>it happened</underline>. I was &amp; am happy about it. It surely is <underline>one</underline> of the ludicrous htings that I'm not in a college. The teachers are as eager as the students.</p>
<p>No more to say.</p>
Endless love to both,
<underline>Jno.</underline>
<p>Mama, <underline>many</underline> people asked about you &amp; said lovely things of you. You certainly impressed them. It was two years ago that we were there. Be very good, Amama! I mean, be very well &amp; wake up peaceful inside.</p>
Jno.
