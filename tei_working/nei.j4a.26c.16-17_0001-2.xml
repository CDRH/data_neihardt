                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>It was so nice to hear from you regarding the plan of using the <hi rend="caps">RED C<del>OU</del><add>LO</add>UD</hi> section of Song of the Indian Wars as choral reading. I hope to type it and send it to Dr. De Boer this weekend. I am still working at the Veterans Administration and my mother's health is failing this year so I don't have too much time. Mother is 92 and last night she dreamt about her German school when she was 10 years old in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The cruel teacher who was a regular Prussian from Germany scolded her and made her cry when she missed one word. She had learned the poem by heart and instead of reading it was reciting it. She thought she was extra superior because she had memorized it as she was a lover of poetry, but when she missed just one word he chastized her severely and her eyes filled with tears and she couldn*t<sic>couldn't</sic> read it and kept reciting it. She recalls the episode with tears even today. Her father took his children out of that old German's school and put them in a little "Dame" school run by a widow in her home and paid fifty cents a week for her instruction for the three children. He could ill afford the money. Then he moved to a farm and the school out there was Norwegian which the children did not understand. Then they were taken out of school to help in the fields and she still mourns the fact that she had so little schooling. And I mourn the fact that I had so much and do so little with is. Mother and father's real ambition was to have their children well educated and we were, but I married at 25 and had a child who was my pride and joy and then my career didn't amount to much, mostly because I was tired and nerv<add>o</add><del>u</del>us, etc, etc. and my classmates all seem so well off by comparison. My little daughter was in the papers in the summer of 1952. You probably saw her picture as

                    drum major of the Highlanders, the girls<add>'</add> band from Iowa City, when they went to Scotland and England. Her picture was in the papers from coast to coast, also in Paramount newsreel, Colliers, and Time magazine. She did very well at Iowa City, was Phi Beta Kappa, and married a law student. He now has a fine position as Industrial Relations man at Kaiser Aluminum Corporation. They recently moved from Baltimore to Ravenswood, West Virginia, on the Ohio River where Kaiser <del>f</del>built a new plant. I like the first chapter of <del>l</del>your <hi rend="caps">SPLENDID WAYFARING</hi> so much for the description of Ohio. I enjoyed the whole book very much, although I think the title is a little misleading today for the average library-user. It sounds like a medieval pilgrimage to me. I only say that<add>,</add> as I know what average people are like. If the title sounded more Western<add>,</add> it would be devoured by the usual Western-style readers which are numerous today. However, I believe it still has a wide circulation at our library. Our library has your <hi rend="caps">BLACK ELK SPEAKS</hi> also.</p>
