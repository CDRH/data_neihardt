                <p>Our friend Helen Neal was here with her two daughters for a swimming meet, there was the shortest time only for conversation, but naturally <unclear>Margaret</unclear> + I wanted to hear about our Neihardts. It is a deep + lingering sorrow that we will no more see our so dear + treasured <unclear>Monna<sic>Mona</sic></unclear>. <add>However</add> I suppose the blessing of having known + loved such a woman should be sufficient gratitude, + the treasure of her memory remains &#8212; She acheived the best that life could, can give a marriage in the ideal of what that state may be. She adored her husband, + he was able in spirit to give her what she needed + wanted &#8212; + she knew the <unclear>security</unclear> of his love &#8212;

                    Her heart + mind gave him tribute I always <unclear>had</unclear> the feeling that Mona felt her husband was a gift from the Divine Creator, + she was blessed in that gift. She loved her <unclear/> <unclear>house</unclear> was happy when her husband was honored (as he certainly deserved to be) + felt every tribute that came to him in much much greater measure than he felt it. When I was in Columbia + spoke of John Neihardt as a friend, it immediately gave me a higher rating. Knowing the beautiful harmony that existed between Mona + John Neihardt knowing that such a marriage existed in our troubled world, gave me <unclear>some</unclear> faith in life.</p>
                
                <p>Your beautiful children are a <unclear/> I did feel that Alice did not have what she merited, but how bravely she faced it, perhaps she was needed to give us <unclear/>, as an example of living &#8212; I'm sure Alice's children must be a great comfort to you &#8212; Glad I saw darling lovely Erica &#8212; Her little sister was asleep</p>
                
                <p>Helen told me that you had <unclear>substituted</unclear> your teaching job In a radio program. I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> how your students valued you, honored friend, but dearly wish there was a chance of hearing you on radio.</p>
                
                <p>It's remarkable + ridiculous that I should

                    have been a chairman to good poetry evenings, + know so little about poetry myself. Our evening on John Neihardt poetry led by Rev. Plant was outstanding + unforgetable &#8212; I <del>do</del> deeply hope this fine man has some of the good things of life, including health + heart's content &#8212; I was by no means indifferent, but never knew what happened to make him leave his pastor + St. Louis but the poet<del>y</del><add>ry</add> evening he gave us, convinced us that he was a sensitive + fine human being.</p>
    
                <p>Don't feel <unclear>propelled</unclear> to answer this honored friend &#8212; should Erica care to fill out the enclosed postal her age, + that of her little sister (only them) I would be happy indeed &#8212; Also a few words <unclear>ne</unclear> grandpa. I shall never be able to show my gratitude for spiritual values received <unclear/> my Neihardts</p>
