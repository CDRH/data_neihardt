Sunday afternoon
Dear Three of you!
<p>I am quite ashamed that I have not written more lately, but perhaps you will excuse me -. I have been very busy. Today so far we have practiced piano, polished the car (Albert the paint part, I the chrome), baked pies, <sic>prach'sed</sic> vocalises - Now we are going out to see Enid. The others have gone on a picnic with Paul and Barbara Miller.</p>
<p>Daddy, I wrote the letter for you to Nebraska U. I</p>
2
<p>especially liked the way you turned the last part - it should make a nice feeling. Please tell us what you hear from there and from Kemper.</p>
<p>Mama, I am eager to learn what you hear from your lamp.</p>
<p>Amama dear, I was so happy for your good, long letter, and I will answer it separately very soon -</p>
<p>I am having lunch tomorrow with La Rhea Slay, the firl violinist I told you about. By the way, she is a pupil of <underline>Scipione Guidi</underline>.</p>
<p>We saw "Torhtla Flat" last evening. It is unusual, and we were glad we went.</p>
<p>it is getting a trifle late, so we'll rush off now. Please write very soon!</p>
<p>I feel so "virtuour" - I am <underline>a jour</underline> in my seed business, practise, and other work!</p>
Endless love as ever to all three,
Hilda
