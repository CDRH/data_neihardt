Dearest Joanie &amp; Elaine:-
<p>We received your dear, dear letter! You are becoming quite an efficient little typist, Joanie &amp; Auntie is proud of you! So is Unka Oddie &amp; Auntie Alice &amp; Auntie Hilda. You must have a good teacher, haven't you?</p>
<p>Joanie, later on, Auntie is going to make you something cute to wear - perhaps for your birthday, if not sooner. Is that all right?</p>
<p>Elaine, we hope you'll love your littler rooster, etc.</p>
Loads of love, dear kiddies, 
&amp; write us again on your machine.
Auntie Eny
