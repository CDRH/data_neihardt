Dear Mr. Aly:
<p>Unfortunately, I did not receive the carbon copy of your letter until today.</p>
<p>Dr. Neihardt will be on Tuesday, April 27. That is completely definite.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the show with Dr. Neihardt. I know that Dick felt it was a memorable experience for him.</p>
Sincerely, 
Doris Wilke
