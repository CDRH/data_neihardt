Dear Mrs. Schuette:
Your beautiful letter of February 4 is deeply appreciated and I thank you for it most heartily. I
also thank each of the members of the Executive Board who signed your letter with you. 
You speak of seeing me on television. I was interviewed by Dick Cavett several days ago and I
suppose you will be seeing me on the Cavett show one of these times. My interview with him lasted
four hours. 
With all kind thoughts for you and your associates there, 
Sincerely,
Your friend 
John G. Neihardt
