Mr. John G. Neihardt, 
Poet Laureate of the State of Nebraska, 
5835 Vine Street, 
LINCOLN, 
Nebraska 68505,
United States of America. 
6th August 1969. 
Dear Mr. Neihardt, 
At the request of many libraries, institutions, poetry organizations and poets in many parts of the world, we have decided to produce a very much enlarged Second Edition of the International Who's Who in Poetry early in 1970, and I am enclosing for your interest a brochure regarding this work together with an Entry Form for the USS1,000 Poetry Awards. I am also enclosing a personal biographical questionnaire for your own use as we much want to include your own biography and bibliography in the enlarged Second Edition. 
It is my intention to devote a considerable section of the book to Poets Laureate of the world and I would be most grateful if you could kindly send a photograph of yourself to me for inclusion in this particular section. 
We are most anxious to be as comprehensive as we possibly can and I would indeed be grateful if you could let me have any information you can obtain regarding names and addresses of poets in the State of Nebraska (to whom we will immediately airmail identical questionnaires) and also of poetry societies, clubs and other organizations in the State of Nebraska, as we want to include a substantial appendix listing, so far as possible, all poetry organizations in the world.
