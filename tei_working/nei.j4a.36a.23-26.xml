                    <salute>Dear John:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>This letter may come as a surprise to you for not hearing from us for so long. But it isn't from not thinking of you so often.</p>
                
                <p>George has been in out of the hospital many times over a period<del>,</del> <add>of time.</add> This last five years he has been failing gradually has arterial scerosis (harding of the arteries). This past few months it has become exceedingly worse. He is very confused and very weak. My entire time has been devoted to him. I dress him shave him, &amp; part of the time fed him as hsi hand shakes so. He is <del/><add>u</add>p &amp; around. but sleep quite a little. I have time for little else, the reason I have not written sooner.</p> 
                
                <p>Last week I wrote to Marianna Ward Shilling in Bancroft to get 
                
                <add><note type="authorial">over</note></add>

                    your address so I could drop you a line so you would know we (<del>I)</del><add><unclear>Geo</unclear>+ I)</add> w<del>as</del><add>ere</add> thinking about you.</p> 
                
                <p>When George was a little active mentally, he would say. "I wish I could see John<add>!</add>." But circumstance never permited<sic>permitted</sic> to arrange it. We never get <add>to</add> Lincoln before this. And here you were so close. It is ashame<sic>a shame</sic>.</p> 
                
                <note type="curatorial"><hi rend="caps">JOHN G. NEIHARDT CENTER</hi></note>
                
                <p>George has always thought so much of you. And from what he has told me in the past, you paid a great part in his life. In fact you were his idol. and he never forgot it. <unclear>Do</unclear>

                <p>He did mention you <del/><add>refered</add><sic>referred</sic> to him in one of your early books. Would <hi rend="underline">you write and tell</hi> <add>^me</add> <hi rend="underline">which one</hi>.? I was new in the family when, <del>when</del> many <del/><add>l</add>ovely things he said about you in regard to your writings has sort of left me. I do find many clippings which I have saved &amp; he worshiped<sic>worshipped</sic>.</p> 
                
                <p>It is so sad to see a person as George, with such a beautiful outlook, wonderful disposition as he had <del>,</del><add>&amp;</add> still <del/><add>h</add>as<add>,</add> decline<add>d</add> so gradually.</p>
                
                <p>I want you to know I tried to contact you when you spoke at Creighton Uni earlier in the year. I call <unclear>radio</unclear> station Creighton &amp; several people<add>,</add> but 
                
                <add><note type="authorial">over</note></add>

                    could not make any conne<unclear/> I thought it would keep George's spirit to know I talked to you.</p> 
                
                <p>This past week I saw in the paper where August 6<add>th</add> will be the <hi rend="underline">7th Neihardt Day</hi> at Bancroft. My how we wish we could be there! But it will be impossible. We also would like to go to Bancroft for the wedding of Marianna's daughter's wedding which is this coming Sat &#8212; July 29. It is Marianna's oldest daughter Becky being married. I can't realize her children are so big.</p>

                <p>Our Jim is in Washington <hi rend="caps">D. C</hi> he is prop. Mgr. in agricu<del/><add>lture B</add>ly. He is very busy. He has never married.

                    <unclear/> guess he is getting more particular <unclear>a</unclear>nd hasn't found the right one. He dates &#8212; but is not against women. He is very busy. He calls us on the phone every week. and trys<sic>tries</sic> to get home twice a year. Especially at Xmas time. He has been a wonderful son. and never had a severe problem for us to w<del/><add>o</add>rry over. which we are very grateful for. My only wish is &#8212; that he was a little closer. Especially now. I have no family. I have to do every thing now. Keep the house <unclear>running</unclear>, take care of any bus<del>y</del><add>iness</add> that arises. <del>I</del><add>A</add>nd most of all with much Love &#8212; <hi rend="caps">TAKE CARE OF HIM</hi>.

                    want me out of his sig<del/><add>h</add>t. <unclear/> guess he feels more secure when I am near.</p> 
                
                <p>He felt a great loss when Clarence passed a number of years ago with the accident he had. Then Clement passing. It left him a alon<del>g</del><add>e</add> family wise. Like me. But we have had a good marriage The past June 29<add>th</add> we were married 46 yr. George was 77yr&#8212;May 12.. When I read in the paper your age. 91 yr <del/><add>I</add> couldn't believe it. It is so wonderful you can do all you are doing <unclear>&amp; able</unclear> to get around.</p>
                
                <p>You have some ardent admirers which one is my dear friend &#8212; She thin<del>gs</del><add>k.</add> you<del>r</del> are wonderful &amp; wants to know all about you.
