Precious Mona:
<p>Just rec'd your letter.</p>
<p>Yes, I have very great faith in Dr. Ford. I'll be thinking about Alice at 10 A.M. tomorrow. She will be all right.</p>
<p>Got 10 more lines this morning; 12 yesterday.</p>
<p>I'll still cleaning up things outdoors.</p>
Endless love,
Jno.
<p>Hiddy should pick up fast after she passes the peak of her trouble. Food for her to be in bed.</p>
