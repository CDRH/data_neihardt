Sunday: 
Dearest Enid:
There is not much to say, save that the flood has gone down, and Sigurd and Maxine are with us awaiting their new house to be made ready for them. Sig is waiting and has two jobs on now, which makes him feel fine. Maxine is dear - and such a help! She has copied the last part of the Messiah for Daddy too. 
I thought you would like to see these snaps. You will recognize the pets! 
Loads of love to you and to Amama 
from Mama.
