Dear Oddie and Enot:
<p>Many thanks for the ten <unclear/> me make the trip! Of course I wasn't "put out". I've been pushing on most satisfactorily with <underline>Jed</underline>, and any letter, and a number have waited to be answered. Enot knows how Gaki is!</p>
<p>You'll no doubt be interested in knowing a bit more about our affairs. Since September 1938, Sig and Max have succeeded in selling $4190 worth of engagements. I think this is re<underline>mark</underline>able, considering the tightened finances everywhere. Sig has handed the business in a methodical and efficient way that certainly arouses my admiration and old Max has pounded out <underline>piles</underline> of letters in addition to what Sig has pounded out.</p>
<p>The above is <underline>gross</underline>. operating expense is of necessity very considerable - car rent, gas, oil, office supplies, stationary, folders, stamps, travelling expense etc. This easily amounts to 1/3 of the gross - perhaps slightly more. We hace all the figures, but this is about right. This leaves $2800 net from lectures. In addition to this we have had $2560, making $<underline>5360</underline></p>

<p>that we have had for our family expenses and needs.</p>
<p>During the same number of months previous to the <unclear/> here considered, my income was $10,000, of which $2,000 was saved.</p>
<p>We have not at any time thus far been <underline>out</underline> of money, but $310 was borrowed last winter and is included in the $2560. There has been nothing bad thus far, expect that we could not keep up Alice's just allowance during recent months.</p>
<p>So long as Jed moves on as though I were getting it largely by dictation, I'll not be too afraid of the future. I do <underline>not</underline> count big on the proceeds therefrom, but the publication of the complete Cycle <underline>will</underline> have a helpful influence at the very least calculation, &amp; <underline>could</underline> do much more. We'll be seeing you</p>
<p>Love to you and to old Lady Alice!</p>
