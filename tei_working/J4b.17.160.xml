Dearest Girlie:
<p>Your seance was most interesting, but unless the names of men unKnown to you are found to be correct, there was nothing you did not already <underline>Know</underline> or <underline>wish</underline> - I have had long experience with mediums and seances and have found it wisest and best to go about <underline>this</underline> world's business as best you can without trying to draw the future World into your present life - You can do <underline>no good</underline> thereby, and can wear yourself out - <underline>Sleep</underline> is the only good way to contact the other World and Praryer.-</p>
Mama.
