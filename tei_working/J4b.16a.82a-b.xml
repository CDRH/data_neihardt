Dear Oddie &amp; Enat:
<p>I've just rec'd an enthusiastic letter from <unclear>Latham</unclear> of Macmillans about <underline>Jed</underline>: This is a paragraph:
"The MS has now been read by our advisors, and also by myself &amp; by others here, and I send you our hearty congratulations. What a satisfaction it must be to have completed this splendid Cycle begun so many years ago, and to complete it so well! Jed Smith is, I think, a completely <strike/> satisfying piece of work, probably your best work to date. It has passages of great beauty and power. There is, as I see it, no let <unclear/> in quality from first to last."</p>
<p>The rest is about promotion Mitchell of Hollywood writes hopefully of the fall &amp; winter season, but we're not sure yet of the summer.</p>
Endless love
Dad
