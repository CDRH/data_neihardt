Dear Hiddy:
I'm sorry about the money being delayed. The post office was closed & there were no stamps at teh drug store. Donovan volunteered to mail the letter with three others he had on his cash register, and I trusted him. I shouldn't have done that. No doubt he mailed the letters too late. If you do not get the money in the same mail with this, phone me & reverse the charge. 
I am planning on the tirp up worth. Are you really eager to go? 
Endless love 
Daddy
