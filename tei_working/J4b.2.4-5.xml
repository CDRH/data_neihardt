My Dear girlie; I wonder if this will reach you in time so <unclear/> you can meet us at the Station as we go thu tomorrow (Sun) afternoon on our way to the Ozarks. I feel that I must see you before leaving. 
Evry thing has been done in such a hurry that I am all dazed, and about all I do konw is that I must see you first a a minute
