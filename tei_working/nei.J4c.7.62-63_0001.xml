Dear Seymour:-

Just received yours of Nov 18., after having marked you a lineabout dedication. Hear I'm to <unclear></unclear>, as I sent proofs from Palo Alto on Nov 16. Curses on my forgetfulness, but I've been driven I tell you.

You bet I want to see the book you mention. I love the books you get up - all peaceful.

Yours

John G.N.
