Dear Mr. Lewin: 
I want to thank you most heartily for your letter in which you renew some old memories. I am so glad
to know that I was able to leave something with you as a student. <del>I</del>
I have not yet read your poetry carefully but shall do so. Mrs. Young, who attends to my mail, is
enclosing something that may interest you. 
It may interest you to knwo that the United Artists are getting out a series of records of my work.
I think the first album is scheduled to appear early in July. We spent eight weeks working on the
recordings. 
With all kind thoughts, your friend, 
John G. Neihardt
