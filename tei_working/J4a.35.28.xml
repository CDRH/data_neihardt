Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Please accept my apologies for my tardiness in thanking you for your thoughtfulness in sending me your magnificent transcription, "The Wonder of It All." I certainly am delighted to have this.</p>
<p>You may be interested to know that I had a letter recently from the president of St. Lawerence University, Mr. Frank Piskor, asking about the possibility of making arrangements to copy your tapes. He said they have a dial access system and would like to have a tape of your readings for their students. I will write him tell him about your tapes that are available in the State Historical Society and at Instructional Television.</p>
<p>I hope you are enjoying your stay in Nebraska. I hope too that I will have an opportunity to visit with you again in the not too distant future. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing you during your visit here some months ago.</p>
<p>Again my sincerest thanks for your thoughtfulness in sending me your great transcription. I shall treasure it. With sincerest wishes,</p>
Your friend,
<signed>Ed Lambert</signed>
Edward C. Lambert
