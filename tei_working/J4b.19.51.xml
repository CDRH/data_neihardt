Precious Amama:
<p>I've just read your letter to Mona, and I'm hurrying to tell you that I love you and that we are eager to see you. Yes, we'll pray to the Only One. Be an awfully good Girl &amp; don't cry. We will be together, &amp; be happy. Either I'll go to Lincoln or instruct at Washington University here. Am hanging on by my eyebrows until I know which it will be.</p>
<p>Anyway - don't let yourself be too sad, precious lady. The silly old world isn't worth it; but it is worth pity &amp; love.</p>
<p>Keep up your faith. It's going to be quite all right one way or another! <hi rend="underline">We love you</hi></p>
