                    <salute>Dear John;</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Returned from a trip to Aztec, <hi rend="caps">N.M.</hi> yesterday and was Thrilled to find your letter waiting for me at the <hi rend="caps">P.O.</hi> t<del>y</del><add>h</add>is morning.</p>
                
                <p>The occasion for the trip was a visit to an old aunt of Faye<add>'</add>s who lives there. She is 85 yrs old ,ve<del>5</del><add>r</add>y bright and alert; a wonderful old pioneer type lady. Went to Loveland, Colo., where W<add>e</add> picked up <del>my</del> Faye<add>'</add>s brother and wife and older si<add>s</add>ter; then<unclear>ce3#</unclear> via Glenwood Springs to Grand Ju nction; to Montrose; Uray to Silverton<add>,</add> over the "Million Dollar Highway"<add>,</add> on to Aztec <hi rend="caps">N.M.</hi> via Durange, Colo <del>to Aztec</del>. Returned via Del Norte and Salida ,across South <del>p</del><add>P</add>ark<add>;</add>through Fair P<del>L</del><add>l</add>ay<add>,</add> to Denv<add>e</add>r. Had a delightful trip.The mountains were beautiful in there<sic>their</sic> autumn glory. I was especially thrill<del>l</del><add>ed</add> by the trip over the "<del>m</del><add>M</add>illion Dollar Highway" through the "<del>a</del><add>A</add>lps of America" for<add>,</add> about 35 yrs. ago ,as Asst. Engineer for the <hi rend="caps">U.S.</hi> Burea<sic>Bureau</sic> of Public Roads, I he<del>p</del><add>l</add>ped stake one <add>of</add> <del>o</del>the most difficult stretches. It was across an almost barren<add>,</add>very sharply pitched, granit<add>e</add> face on Red Mountain<add>,</add> with <add>a</add> 1200 ft canyon just below. I had to set up the transit in any crevass<del>e</del> I could find and the boys with the rods worked on ropes attached to iron pins set in the rock above.</p> 
                    
                <p>Yes<add>-</add> John there does seem to be some sort of phsycic<sic>psychic</sic> connection between us. I have wo<add>n</add>dered some times; we were both close to our mothers<add>,</add>and they were very, very, close. Perhaps, in some way, this gives us a sort of ph<del>y</del><add>s</add>ycic<sic>psychic</sic> relationsh<add>i</add>p. Any way, I am very happy about it.</p>
                    
                <p>I did know that you were connected in some way with the University at Columbia, but did not know your address. Am surely glad that thi<del>g</del><add>n</add>gs have worked out so well for you and yours. I may be confused in my recolections<sic>recollections</sic><add>,</add> but I believe that Sigurd was just leaving you the day we visited you at Branso<add>n</add>. If my memor<del>i</del><add>y</add> is correct, he had been trained

                    in music, and was<del>t</del> then setting out on a more commercial task, perhaps sell ing musical instruments. I just sensed that you fo<del>r</del><add>l</add>ks were troubled about him. If this is correct, it is surely grand that he "found himself" in mechanical lines instead of Art. One time years ago, you told me that "Just as the plant lived to produce the flower and then died,so the gener<del>at</del>ation lived to produce great artists". Althoug<del>y</del><add>h</add> I said nothing, I could never quite accept that philosiphy<sic>philosophy</sic> and wondered <del/>if,in the Great Plan, the <hi rend="underline">seed</hi> was not the culmination<add>,</add> rather than the <hi rend="underline">Flower</hi>.</p>
                    
                <p>Does Mona still work at her sculpturing ? When we were there, she was nearing completion of a bust of some great educator, head of the " Collage<sic>College</sic> of the Ozarks,? of Of the Hills ?"<add>,</add> Does it still exist?</p>
                    
                <p>I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that you are enjoying your hobby of horses and the a<del>w</del><add>s</add>sociation with other horse lovers .(Did you ever make your "trek" over the great Salt Flats,? I have been across them several times by car and each time I thought of you and wondered.) I say I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> that you are enjoying your hobby for ours is Irish Setter dogs . We still have "Boyne," 11 yrs. old, registered as "Atomic Inasion<sic>Invasion</sic>"<add>,</add>sired by Finefield Invasion, by Klieglight of Arrogan,<add>&#8212; who was</add> the greastest<sic>greatest</sic> <del>e</del>Iris<del/><add>h</add> Setter champion the <hi rend="caps">U.S.</hi> ever produced. We showed him for a couple of seasons, around the Mid<add>-</add>West Circuit ,as apupy<sic>a puppy</sic> novice<add>,</add>and at 2yrs. He was just "coming into his own" when , with us<add>,</add>on a trailer trip, in 1949,he was hit by an express train on a beach at Pensacola,Fla.. His leg was broken in the<del>r</del> right thigh and the pelvic arch broken. A<add>f</add>ter a battle ,we pulled him through, but his gait was spoiled for the ring. We only used him for breeding once , to provide for his soccessor<sic>successor</sic> "Red Feather Flash" now 5yrs.old. Flash, thoug<del>y</del><add>h</add> a disappo<unclear><del>i</del><add>n</add>n<del>t</del><add>t</add></unclear>memt<sic>disappointment</sic> in certain show qualities,<add>(</add>too many of the weaknesses of <del>ht</del><add>th</add>e <del>l</del><add>m</add>other, Lady of Lockwoo<del>k</del>d, is a wonderfully intelligent dog. Though we have never been blessed with children, we have had the wonderful<add>,</add>unselfish <hi rend="underline">inspiring</hi> love, yes worship, of some great dogs. (Some day Iwill<sic>I will</sic> tell you more about them.<del>0</del><add>)</add> I have just one advantage over you in my hobby;just a lit<unclear><del>t</del><add>l</add></unclear><sic>little</sic> closer association . Am not ashamed to say that two of my dogs have died in my arms and someday<add>,</add>before too long Boyne will.</p>
