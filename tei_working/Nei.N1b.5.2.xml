Dear Mr. Husted:
I have been reviewing my tangle of mail, and I am afraid I did not reply to your letter of March 11,
1973. Certainly I intended to reply, for I was pleased with your proposition that you come here
during the summer and do some photographing. 
If I did not answer you, I beg you to pardon me on the grounds that I have been helping in the
recording of my work by the United Artists. We spent eight weeks at the job and it nearly demolished
me. I realize that this is not an excuse but it is an explanation. 
If you are still interested, please write me again and I will try to be more prompt. 
The first album is to be issued in July, and I understand there will be number of them. 
With all kind thoughts, sincerely, 
John G. Neihardt
