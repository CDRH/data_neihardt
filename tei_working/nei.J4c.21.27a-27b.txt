<p>Dear Mrs. Aly:</p>

	<p>Here is really great news! I've just heard, after 60 years, from my old pal - the best I ever had - John Chaffee! He lives only 50 miles north of your! His address is:

				John E. Chaffee
				K. P. Apartment #4,
				  Albany, Oregon.

John was my pal(<hi rend="underline">and only public</hi> when I was writing <hi rend="underline">Chalboa</hi> (dedicated to him) and <hi rend="underline">The Wizard of the Wind</hi>. These, as I think you

know, were "epics" (!!) and I destroyed them. John was my only public excepting prof. Durrin &amp; my ardent fan when I was doing <hi rend="underline">The Divine Enchantment</hi>. I had the typed <hi rend="caps">MS</hi> with me in 1898 when John and I were on a hobo trip from K. C. to Sumner, Mo. and bacnk. The <hi rend="caps">M. S.</hi> was my most precious possession. The story of our doings is at least as good as Tom Sawyer's and Huck Finn's.

It's a whale of a story of self-imposed hardships, fun, and happy hell-raising. <hi rend="underline">We were alive</hi> from our toes to the tops of our heads. We never did any harm to anyone, not even ourselves. 
<hi rend="underline">We invented</hi> adventures.</p> 
	<p>You should see old John. He lost his wife last August and is lost. They were married 55 years.

This is a piece of good fortune - a big piece out of my early life when I was all hope and longing. What John may have forgotten, I know I'll remember. It is all so vivid, and <hi rend="underline">so</hi> good to recall. Is there a finer relationship (excepting only perfect marriage) than such comradeship?</p>

				<p>Kindest from us here to you there</p>
