                    <dateline>Tuesday</dateline>
                
                    <salute>Dear John,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Thank you for the loan. It certainly saved the day. Both the records and the al<del>m</del><add>b</add>ums were fini<del>w</del><add>s</add>hed yesterday. The record people are going to bill me but the printer would not have let me have the albums if I could not have paid for them at the time. So, if your check had not arrived yesterday the albums would still be s<del>t</del><add>i</add>tting at the printers.</p>
                
                <p>The printing bill was a little less than I expected so I am sending a check for $<del>2<unclear/></del><add>40</add>.00. I will pay the <del><unclear>loan</unclear> up</del><add><hi rend="caps">REMAINDER</hi></add> in <del/><add>8</add><del/> $20.00 installments, <hi rend="underline">or</hi> as soon as the money becomes available from record sales, whichever takes the less time. I am hoping that the record sales will enable me to pay it off in much less than ten months.</p>
                
                <p>I am sending twenty albums to you. Would you autograph them and send them back as soon as possible? I think you can send them in the same box they arrive in if you wrap them carefully. As soon as I recieve the autographed albums I will send them to the people who ordered records on the advance sale basis.</p>
                
                <p>I am also sending you two records for your own use. If you have need for any more, let me know and I will send them to you. The two records I am sending are in a seperate package.</p>
                
                <p>Did you recieve the class record books? As soon as I reci<del>r</del><add>e</add>ve the mailing list I will send out mailers to you<sic>your</sic> former students. The sooner we can do this, the better. We should send them before they have a chance to go on vacations and things. Let me know how you are progressing on the mailing list.</p>
                
                <p>By the way, did you ever find the two records of the Lyrics? I hope it turned up alright.</p>

                <p>Tell Alice and Mr. Cook that I wish them the best of luck on their new stable. Since, as you mentioned, you are "the bank," I wish you and your wife luck on it too. It sounds like a fine idea and should do well.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks again for the loan. It really saved the day. I'm sure you will be interested in how much the records have cost so far. Here is a breakdown of the costs:
                    <lb/>
                    Stewart Photo Co.,  16x20 print,            $3.<del>00</del><add>12</add>
                    Christy-Shepard,    <del/><add>F</add>inal print and          33.80
                                        air brush work,
                    Century Record Co., Masters and stampers,                     87.36
                    Bert-Co Press,      Albums,             <hi rend="underline">150.90</hi>
                    
                    <hi rend="caps">TOTAL TO DATE</hi>                          $275.18</p>
                
                <p>I have not yet recieved the bill for the finished records but it will be somewhere around $70.00. The mailer will cost about $80.00 for printing and postage. The postage on 100 records will be around $30.00. So the total for 100 records will be about $450. This is almost twice what I expected it to be. But the best way to find out how much it costs to put out a record is to <hi rend="underline">put one out</hi>. I have no doubts about our making money on the project. The sale of 110 records will pay back the original investment, and we have already sold 14 without any advertising other than the letter you read in class and the one I wrote to the Speech and English departments. And these people bou<del>t</del><add>g</add>ht the record sight unseen. When others have a chance to see the album and realize that it is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> just record in a paper envelope but a regu<del>al</del><add>la</add>r <hi rend="caps">LP</hi> as they would find in record stores, I think sales will go up even more.</p>
                
                <p>Well, enough of business for awhile. Give all your family my best wishes.</p>
