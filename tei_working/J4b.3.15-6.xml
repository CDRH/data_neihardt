was well taken by the crowd. Thompson, who sat on the rootrim said, after we'd gave to bed! "John, I always think of you as young, & when you were in the <del/ both tub just now you seemed young, But at the church, while you were speaking you seemed very very old, not decrepit, but like Moses, telling people what they taught to know", wasn't that funny?
