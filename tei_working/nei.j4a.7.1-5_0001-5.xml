                <p>Replying to your second letter let me say first that <unclear/> were Two Forsythes&#8212; no relatives but both on Sheridan's Staff and devoted to him. One, James <hi rend="caps">W.</hi> ("Tony") Forsyth was a West Pointer and was, long after Sheridan's death, the successor of Custer in command of the 7th cavalry in the unfortunate affair of Wounded Knee + the Drexel mission near Pine Ridge Agency. "Tony" was a gentleman and had a host of friends. (I was proud to be one of them) but he was hardly a good judge of the red man. Second, Geo. <hi rend="caps">A.</hi> ("Sandy") was not a West Pointer but came into the War with <unclear/> Illinois Cavalry + served for years with Sheridan. He was a most genial, lovable man who had a host of friends throughout the service (and I was proud to be one of them) and his fight with Roman Nose was most graphically described by himself years ago in one of the magazines + it was republished in a book the name of which

                at this moment escapes me. It was a great defensive fight, but crippled Sandy to his dying day. I always understood the "Sandy" to be from Alexander which, I think, was his middle name.</p>
                
                <p>Red Cloud I never saw. His rival. Spotted Tail, I know well: Cook says Red Cloud (Mahpiya Luta) was by long odds the bigger finer man as well a chief. Gen. Terry I know but slightly and not but Twice. Custer ditto. Reno treated me with the utmost courtesy when I was once under his command but I never saw him after the campaign of 76 which proved his undoing. He never seemed to get over that awful day or the Little Big Horn: he became morose, sullen, and when in liquor quarrelsome. <unclear/> <unclear>only</unclear> that drove him, I believe, insane. He was courtmartialed + died long ago</p> 
                
                <p>Crook, I knew intimately + loved. He was the best man in the army to deal with Indians + could he have been in control of the Indian Bureau <unclear/> could have <unclear>gone</unclear> far.</p>
                
                <p>He was, as you say; a fighter but he fought <hi rend="underline">for</hi> the Indian more frequently than against him:</p>

                <p>You ask about Cody. I knew him intimately + until the day of his death. He was in no sense a braggart. Indeed, when he was chief scout with my regiment we thought him very modest. After he had long been "in the dramatic line" he built up the incident of the death of "Yellow Hand" (should be <hi rend="underline">Hair</hi> instead of  <hi rend="underline">hand</hi>. in Cheyenne it is Hay or <unclear>wye</unclear> into a very theatrical performance and grew to believe it&#8212; I haven't a doubt. But it was all as I described it in 1879&#8212; without any <unclear>preliminary</unclear> challenging or "play acting". Bill was <hi rend="underline">sui generis</hi> &#8212; the best scout, the best kind of a fellow + comrade, and about as really unspoiled as such a universal idol could well be. Men + women, both, bled him + preyed upon him. He was lavish to a fault. You cannot speak too highly of Cody as he was in the old days. He was not himself when he essayed the "bringing in" of

                <p>"Idiosyncracies" in either of the Forsythes I do not recall. They were not sufficiently marked. Bentoon was a stranger to us but your estimate accords with all that Godfrey + other 7th Calvary men have said of him. He was fine.</p>
