Dear Dr. Neihardt:
Listening to you was like food or drink after a long hard March. 
I am trying to find your writings. The library is getting one book, the one you mentioned on T.V.
You must have earlier writing's
I am a mystic, and much interested in spiritual matters. 
I know the real meaning of mysticism, as I know you do. 
I'd love to know more from one much wiser than I. 
Life is a lonely waiting to find spiritual relatives - they are <unclear/> among the young Hippies so called 

today, but who are really aware as you declared on T.V. 
I am in early sixtie's and became aware nearly 18 years ago, after much pondering. 
I read the writings of 
Glena Clark of MacAlester College in Minnesota. 
I also read Evelyn Underhill and Saint Theresa: 
I read the religions, each one, <unclear>before</unclear> I turned to the Mystics. 
If its possible to answer, tell me about your poems, where I can get them, and all your books. I recognize you as a great Soul. your views on animal kililng were also mine. 
My dearest wishes, 
Norma Conlin
