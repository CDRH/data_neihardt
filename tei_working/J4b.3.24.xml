TO SIGURD, SCARCELY THREE. 
When you are old enough to know
The joys of kite and boat and bow 
And other suchlike splendid things 
That boyhood's rounded decade brings,
I shall not give you tropes and rhymes;
But, rising to those rousing times,
I shall ply well the craft I know 
Of shaping kite and boat and bow,
For you shall teach me once again 
The goodly art of being ten.
Meanwhile, as on a rainy day
When 'tis not possible to play,
The while you do your best to grow 
I ply the other craft I know
And strive to build for you the mood
Of daring and of fortitude 
In fitted word and shapen phrase, 
Against those later wonder-days
When first you glimpse the world of men
Beyond the other side of ten.
