Dear Oddie &amp; Enat:
<p>I've just rec'd an enthusiastic letter from Laiham of MacMillans about <underline>Jed</underline>: this is a paragraph:
"The MS has now been read by our advisers, and also by myself &amp; by others here, and I send you our hearty congratulations. What a satisfaction it must be to have completed this splendid Cycle begun so many years ago, and to complete it so well! <underline>Jed Smith</underline> is, I think, a completely <strike/> satisfying pieve of work, probably your best work to date. It has passages of great beauty and power. There is, as I see it, no let down in quality from first to last."</p>
<p>The rest is about promotion. Mitchell of Hollywood writes hopefully of the fall &amp; winter season, but we're not sure yet of the summer.</p>
Endless love
Dad
