Mr. Elmer Holm, 
542 North 14th St.,
Lincoln, Nebraska.
Dear Mr. Holm:
<p>Although it has been a long while since I had the pleasure of seeing you and Mrs. Holm, I have thought of you both often and have been hearing of your splendid work on the biography.</p>
<p>For nearly two years I arranged lecture tours for my father, also assisted as pianist on the programs. Following this work I went back into my old job with The Baldwin Piano Co., where I am at present. My duties are made up of selling, practicing, and playing occasionally over the radio stations.</p>
<p>My friend, John R. Shannon, travelling representative of Continental Concerts, will be in Lincoln this week end. He will try to get in touch with you. I am eager for you to have a chat with him, for he is genuinely interested in your proposed Laureate Tour. Mr. Shannon is a first class promoter. He is familiar with the excellent material which you have written for use in the letters of solicitation. He feels certain that this approach, together with certain plans he has in mind pertaining to the community advertising, will result in something that is worthwhile to all concerned.</p>
With very best wishes to you and Mrs. Holm for a most satisfactory NEW YEAR,
Sigurd Neihardt and family.
