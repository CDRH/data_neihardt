<p>Please write me soon! I'll write a long detailed letter at least onces a wk! How was the 4th?</p>
Dear Daddy, Mama, Max, Joan and Elaine,
<p>Here is a view of our Lovely Lake Aloaloa. I've passed both my swimming tests so this morning. I went for a dip off the dock. Water was cool and is invigorating.</p>
<p>Everything is very nice here. We'll really begin our regular schedule Monday.</p>
<p>Daddy, would you please send me the words to your Indian song "Wee how the Sacred sun is walking" etc.?</p>
Loads of Love,
Alice
