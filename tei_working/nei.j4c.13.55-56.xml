<salute>Dear Comrade:</salute>
</opener>
<p>Your letter reached me early in my vacation here, and things were happening, so that I've neglected to answer your questions. I'm ashamed and sorry.</p>

<p>Of course you can do the article on me better than anyone else.</p>

<p>As to Indian poetry by Indians, the best I know is in "Indian Love Songs" published by Macmillan. The title is misleading + was chosen in the hope of attracting the foolish public. There are genuine religious songs in the collection, + some very beautiful. All are true + fine. So much that has been published in this line is damned sentimentalism concocted by vain white persons hoping to make an impression.</p>

<p>I suppose a complete discussion of Indian poetry <del/> would have to include Mary Austin's work, and a fairly fashionable article moved include Witter Bynner, who is all right at a ladies' tea. Mary Austin knows, however.</p>

<p>No <hi rend="underline">Indian writer</hi> is doing anything worthwhile at all. Indian poetry grew out of the old tribal life. I was not, apparently, the product of individual poets in the way ours is.</p>

<p>Sarett is worth while surely. Alexander's "God's Drum" contains genuine Indian stuff, but does not move me deeply as do the mystical religious poems of "Indian love songs". 
<pb facs="nei.j4c.13.55-56_0002"/>
<fw type="curatorial">56</fw>
Don't forget Mary Austin. Real stuff there, tho' not of great interest to me, since I am as I am. I am not interested in <hi rend="underline">Indians</hi> as <hi rend="underline">Indians</hi> - only as people in a peculiar situation. Human nature in the grip of fate - not Indian nature as a curiosity - interests me. And their poetry interests me only because it is human + poetry. I'm perhaps the only <del/> writer this feels in this way. Had they been Chinese or Japs or <del/> Zulus in a similar situation, my interest would have been the same.</p>

<p>Yes, your feeling about Sarett + Alexander is not wholly unjustified I suspect, though God knows <del/> I can not be envious + would stand for either against their enemies.</p>

<p><del>Alexander is less the systematizing</del></p>

<p>In his work on other subjects, Alexander is perhaps less the systematizing philosopher than the philosophical mystic. There often + often he scores, with illuminating flashes. He has genius I feel sure. Surely his learning is enormous, and as an ethnologist <del/> he has <del/> made <del/> large and important. Contributions to the study of the Indian.</p>

<p>I'm going back to St. Louis Saturday.</p>
