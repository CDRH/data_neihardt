Sat.
Dear Enat and Oddie:
<p>In fastening the stone to the ring with the screw, I pulled too tight and fractured the yellow stone. Only a faint hair line of fracture was visible, and it seemed hardly likely to give way. But for this, the set would have stood up under the blow it gat; also, without the blow it would probably have held indefinitely. The plan for fastening was excellecnt, as it involved <underline>no</underline> use of cement.</p>
<p>Please return the ring and I'll set another stone. This time I'll not fracture it in fastening, and</p>

<p>it will hold forever. I'll probably use all amethyst, or maybe pale amethyst with a new garnet top.</p>
<p>Evidently the ring is too light. If you want it slightly enlarged, tell me.</p>
<p>We've had lovely rains in time, and the place is all cozily green.</p>
<p>Jed Smith is in page proofs, and should soon be in plates. The N.Y. Times announced it lately.</p>
<p>Had you heard of the war in Europe? It seems the Dutch and the Rooshian's are having a little argument.</p>
<p>Buy a bond today and own a share of America.</p>
<p>Hurrah for our new Wub!</p>
With love always
