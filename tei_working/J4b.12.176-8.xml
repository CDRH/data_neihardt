My own Darling: 
Your good letter ex plained everything so well and now please don't think of me as any other way than <del>but</del> in fine shape, and getting a little letter each day. If nothing else works out for you why can you not state your vacation soon in a way that will really make you happy and rest you from the heat? I understand every thing so much better now thanks to your good letter - many thanks!
