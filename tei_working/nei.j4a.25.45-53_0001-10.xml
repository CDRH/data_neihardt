                    <salute>Dearest Dr. &amp; Mrs. Neihardt,</salute> 
                </opener>
                <p>Way past time to write that I love you! I'm sorry I didn't get to see you again. I'm sorry I didn't get to tell you good bye. Happened to see Hilda downtown &#8212; I'm sure she wondered what-ever was the matter with me.</p>
                
                <p>I was broken hearted when she saw me. because I knew that Mother Linda &amp; Bobby &amp; I had to go with nothing sellted about <hi rend="caps">C</hi>_'s control over my Mother's <unclear>funds</unclear>; the divorce in court &amp; <hi rend="underline">ignored</hi> <hi rend="caps">ETC &#8212; ETC &#8212; AD INFINITUM.</hi></p>
                
                <p>We are fortunate to have had the home of one of my parent's old friends (friends for over 35 years) offered us for sanctuary. Just as no one believed he <add>Cliff</add> could have mistreated &amp; hurt us in Columbia as
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.25.45-53_0004"/>

                    he did, so no one believes he can do it here. However, he is a very determined, clever &amp; ruthless person for all his smooth &amp; charming ways, especially with women.</p>
                
                <p>The children, Linda &amp; Bobby, are happier wothout him in the same town, but they, like me, miss Columbia which had been the only home we knew. Then we lived "close at home" in ways no on knew or realized. Today, for example, was a day of rain, when I missed my "woods" &amp; the chance to stand on the steps Daddy made &amp; look over all the plants &amp; trees.</p>
                
                <p>There are no flowers for me here &#8212; but there are three florists shops I can walk by! One of the shops is almost full of poinsettas the down town stores are decorated. Providence is truly an interesting city.</p>
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.25.45-53_0005"/>

                <p>In the true sense we are exiles. Mrs. Neihardt, guess what keepsake I brought with me &amp; have in my top dresser drawer! I have my "Mona Neihart<sic>Neihardt</sic> piece &#8212; my cherub!" Also, I have the note Dr. <hi rend="caps">N.</hi> wrote me in Jan. &amp; the "blue" card with his Christmas poem on it. . .</p>
                
                <p>. . . <hi rend="caps">SORRY AN INTERUPTION </hi>. . . . .</p>
                
                <p>I have been teaching half days in a fine school. At the time I took the half day job I still expected things to be cleared up so I could go ahead &amp; work on the <hi rend="caps">M.A.</hi> &#8212; &amp; then the Ph.D! Now, I don't know what to do, because I do not have anyone to advise me <unclear>or</unclear> at least give their opinion. That was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life to have had the advice to "listen to you"
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.25.45-53_0006"/>
                    
                <fw type="curatorial">50</fw>
                
                    as you know I loved the opportunity of being the student &amp; the opportunity thus provided to listen to your lectures. It was sheet heaven, to have been grader for you for as long as I was permitted to go to school. I miss Dr. Craig's lectures &amp; Dr. Moffett's &#8212; the world was better where I knew I could go to class &amp; hear the three of you. I remember all I can of you.</p>
                
                <p>It was a grave disappointment not to have at least spoken to Dr. Moffett just one more time. Dr. Craig spoke to me on Broadway once. It was September of this year. Of course, I do not know that he remembered who I was, but I was happy he spoke.</p>
                
                <p>Back to Graduate School &#8212; until I got so tired &amp; discouraged I felt pretty sure of being admitted to Brown University. I can walk to the school where I teach from here &amp; I can walk to Brown &amp; that saves bus fare. Are you still

                    willing to write <hi rend="double underline">one</hi> more letter recommending me for graduate study. I told both Dr. Anderson (English Dept.) &amp; Dr. Case &amp; Dr. Smith (Education Dept.) that <hi rend="underline">two</hi> people were back of me <hi rend="underline">you</hi> in English &amp; Earl <add>(<hi rend="caps">W.E. DRAKE</hi>)</add> in Education. I said no more than that except for this one remark: I did say the first time I saw Dr. Anderson, English, that I knew I seemed pretty <hi rend="underline">old</hi> to <hi rend="underline">try</hi> to get two degrees in order to teach but that last year "Dr. Craig said I wasn't" I have purposely not mentioned any names here. I have purposely kept everything

                    on a business basis &amp; for an interview or appointment of only a few minutes. How long it will take for a "whispering campaign" like Cliff used in Columbia. I know not.</p>
                
                <p>Would you think I should send in <add>to Brown with application</add> some of my manuscripts of my poems or would you think it best not to? The application form for admission asked about printed published &amp; mss. work. I salvaged some of it . . . . but very little of 50 years work.</p>
                
                <p>If you are willing to write the letter should go to Dean of the Graduate School, Brown University, Providence 12, Rhode Island.</p>
                
                <p>If you sense discouragement it is real but I hope to rise out of it. God Bless &amp; keep you &#8212; each one of you &#8212; your <hi rend="underline">pets</hi> &amp; horses, too.</p> <closer><salute>Love</salute> <signed>Pat.</signed></closer>
