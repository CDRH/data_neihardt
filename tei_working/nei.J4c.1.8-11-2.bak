My dear Mr. Davis:-
	So you would give a million dollars for my exuberance?
I reject the offer; it is not for sale. If there is anything
a man needs in his business in this world it is exuberance -
a boiling over of life-force.
	You judge rightly when you say that I have still some of
the illusion of youth. This same thing said by an enemy would
mean differently than it does from you. But, I imagine, you
have seen much of life and are no longer as young as you were
once. Therefore, you will see the truth in what I wish to say.
	I have illusions of youth; but I am conscious of the fact.
I want to be always "the boy who wouldn't grow up".
	Of old, the Greeks felt how great youth is, and so they
made their gods immortally young. All poets, painters,
musicians, who were given at birth the Olympian bigness, were
the eternally young.    May the devil pity me and my plane
if I ever become blase. Look at the face of Richard Realf,
as shown in the last photograph he had taken. Behind the scars
there is the spirit of the boy. I could print great bunches
of paper with examples proving this great fact. God keep us
young!
	My friend, doesn't it take something of the spirit of 
a boy to make a man attempt any great labor? If he were too
wise, wouldn't he give up at the start? Must we not be blind
before we can really see?
	If you were out here now, you poor, city-ridden man! you
would see some glorious illusions. Spring is the most inspiring
season of the whole year; and still behind the green and the 
garish riot of color there is the rotten leaf, the brown, prosaic
old earth. It's all superficial - I know that. But I want to
be humbugged. I don't want to see the skeleton. Give me the
beautiful illusions of the flesh. I want to  believe things.
	Five years ago I was older than I am now. Our family
had a hell of a fight to get into the air made for us. I haven't
always lived in the country. I snarled at sacred things like
a mad dog. I was socialistic, atheistic. I am the former now,
but not the latter - altho' I never pray. My prayer is in being
glad and doing my damndest. And I used to read Schopenhauer,
thinking fondly of that time when I should be wiped out, and 
be no more than a dead dog.
	But I got up and shook all that off. I took on illusions,
and I am growing steadily younger. During the past month, I
have proven my ability to read Shelley, Keats, Shakespere <sic>Shakespeare</sic>
works on the higher bible criticism, living in the upper air;
and at the same time make a sailing boat for a boy and enjoy
doing it.
	From time to time I shall take on more illusions as I
find those which seem beautiful.
