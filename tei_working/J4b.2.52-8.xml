Monday A.M. Nov 20'21. 
Dear Ones:- 
I arrived here at 10:30 last ngiht after a rather exciting trip last week the most destructive storm ever known in these parts swept up the Columbia River. It was sleet, the conducter of our train was burried 22 feet deep in a snow (or rather sleet) slide for 70 hours. the sleet rolled down the steep mountains (that overbang the track) like water, & 45 miles of track were covered from 3 to 70 feet deep along the Columbia. I came up here on the first train out of Portland for a week. Though the drifts had melted much under a warm rain, they were still, in many places, higher than the train.

I sat in the smoker near the conductor & read his orders as he got then. He finished them to a seat in front him. It was <unclear/> to <unclear/> of dangerous stretches of track & had budges over tremendous torrents. I didn't feel afraid, though, "I will through delays". The ride for 150 miles along the Columbia river was wroth a lot of travelling. A staggering morning picture, surely. The famous Columbia highway follows the track, & there were 160 cars snowed under in a distance of 50 miles. Many were twenty feet under, I was told. It was good for me to see the Columbia River;

as it was so <unclear/> in the old house dogs of the fur trade Jed smith passed up that way on his return from California, after the cumbqua massacre. I saw the arapaqua river, too I do my sutnt here at Whitman College this afternoon. Just called up President Peurose, & he is sending my mail over, so I'm all on my toes waiting to hear from <unclear/>. 
As soon as I got up this morning, I spent my blue suit and to the <ucnlear/> & dressed as it was badly rumpled. 
You should have seen me doing a <unclear/> in the bathroom of my apartment at the <unclear/> club! 
I watched about a dozen

<unclear/> & a suit of underwear! had cots of water & <unclear/>, & I did a bullly job. Of course, I sent my shirts & colllors out. 
Am feeling especially well this morning. hav ecaught up on sleep, at last. 
I played a nice truck on the R.r. Co up from Frisco. I could have taken an evening train with two nigths on the way, or a morning train with one night on way. I took the latter, of course, and did not get a pullman <unclear/>, which was $4.85 to Portland. Instead, I waited until bed time & then

asked the Pullman conductor how for I could sleep for the minimum. He was a deuce of a nice chap & he put me through until 9:45 next morning for <del>$250 3</del> $2.03. At 9:45 I went into the chair car. So I saved $2.82, & had just as good a time as the rich fools. Talk about Hebraism! 
It costs like sin to travel now. I keep my hand off my money, for fear the damned stuff, will melt. But I'll make some money from now on. 
I haven't seen any place where I'd rather live than where you are now.

some parts of Oregon are pleasing - more so to me, than California. But there are drawbacks, as I learned. Took hard at the country around Jan there & be sure that fern swore beautiful places expect me in the U.S. as for the winters there, they can't be very bad; & we well learn to stand the heat, I'm sure. Nothing grows wild out here - nothing to eat, I mean. It's a beautiful country, but tight-fisted. And I despise the owrds of Coast. I guess I'm decent. The Coast is bad bad. The women show that they count on sex for everything. Of course, there are good people- hundreds of thousands of them- but they do not set the standards. 
How I hate brazen femininity! The commonly seen woman's

face on the Coast is cruel & big-like, Mona just as you said they were in Paris. 
Kisses to all my darling Wubs & for the big folks too! I'll be home no later than Monday, Dec 12, as I figure now. Perhaps a day or so sooner. 
Lots of love - oceans of it.

The boy just now brought my suit - $1.00. I wish I could have said it to one of you! This makes three blessings I've had- the others at 75c
