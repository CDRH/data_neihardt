Dearest Enid &amp; Ollie:
<p>We are enjoying wonderful air here near Denver. Had a fine trip and a visit to Grandma Culler's Homestead at Stockton Kansas. Have written in a letter to Southwood, which is for you too. We are going on to Boulder soon where we hope for Mail from St. Louis. Daddy and I are both well and having a glorious time. Love without end to our darling children</p>
from Mama Mother.
