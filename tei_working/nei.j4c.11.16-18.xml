<dateline>Branson, March 11, '26</dateline>

<salute>Dear Comrade:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I've been, &amp; still am, working <del/> <add>at</add> high pressure, as I haven't done since my first year on the Minneapolis Journal. I've done three weekly installments for the K.C. Journal-Post and the first appeared last Sunday (the 7th). The response has been more than I expected so soon. The Sunday Ed. says he <del/>hears "much admiring comment", &amp; one chap wrote a letter to the Journal-Post, chortling with joy. Among other things he said: "If Neihardt can keep up this pace, his reviews &amp; comment are destined to become a distinct contribution to the culture of the middle west" etc.</p>

<p>It looks good now.</p>

<p>I suppose you sent your 300 word article to Latham. I hope he will use it with what I sent. The whole business would make powerful propoganda - your explanatory article with the appreciations.</p>

<p>Golly! How I do hope you may be with Macmillans in two years! You'd like it. &amp; you could do a lot of good. It's great to think about. I wish that damned Pulitzer Prize would go where it belongs this year! Then so much would be made easy.</p>

<p>Yes, Mary <hi rend="underline">is</hi> "some kid", as you say. We're all glad to hear of her having gotten what she wants.</p>

<p>We are up in the air, as to moving and all that. Can't know much yet. But we'll hardly be here another winter. I love these hills, though, &amp; shall miss them. Sig is making rapid progress in music - plays like the dickens, really: there's a devouring flame in him. He might arrive, &amp; at any rate he must have a strong teacher soon.

Enid too is making good progress. She's less brilliant in music than Sig, whose hands seem to know more than they should; but Enid is very steady &amp; sure, &amp; her playing is like her character. Sig is a flame in a high wind or nothing. The little devil dreams music, &amp; all his consciousness is colored with the one intention. He said the other day: "Daddy, I want to go where all the people around me will be fools for music!" He's not "heady" at all. There's a very obvious humility about him whenever big things are to be considered. He heard Percy Grainger at Springfield lately, &amp; since then he has made more rapid progress than ever.</p>

<p>300 lines on The <hi rend="underline">Messiah.</hi> You bet you are to see it. Nothing prevents now but the task of typewriting. Enid is studying typing with an expert here - the touch system - &amp; she swears she'll be my secretary. Hasten the day! The damned machine always did get my goat.</p>

<p>Why can't you say more about the Book? I want to know. But, of course, I've been away from you so long that you probably wouldn't know where to begin.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Love to you, &amp; every kind thought for Mrs. House. I really don't forget her goodness.</salute>
