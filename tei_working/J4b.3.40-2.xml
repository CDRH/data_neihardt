My dear girl;-
I was so sorry to find that I had not sent you all the films. The way it happened, I had sent these special ones to be printed and they were in a different envelope, I wish I might have them some time again, that I would like to make a set for Mrs. Brown. Poor girl she is still in Bancroft waiting for a customer, and is so anxious to get away. I expect to see her on my way to minneapolis, I don't know get how it will to about stopping in Sioux City. For my return will go by the way of <unclear/> Iowa and spring my mother home with me. I expect now to be in Omaha about the first week of Dec. Some of the Neihardt club people hav ebeen out of town, so the delay, i have not been one bit well, hope I will perk up a bit

fore I start. The all howled at the picture you must have made churning those boy. good for you, they will like you a lot better when they find you have fight in you. 
Oh I must tell that Hilda has the dearest little coat made from yours and Enid the society dress. Next year Alice will have a coat out of the white corduroy you gave us before leaving Bancroft. OH I guess there is no linger of us forgetting you very soon for a number of reaosn. Our new school house is nearly ready to be occupied and it is a beauty I have resigned from the parent. There is so much walking and I can't stand. So have resigned. I hated to, I was so interested in the work to be done and doing. Every body is well at the other ranch and every body looks for their turn to read your letters. I have about <unclear/> letters to write and must tell you my dear little girl much love and good bye A.M. Neihardt
