my dear little girl you will wonder what has happened that I could neglect you so long. Yell Lee tell you. The week you left I got into that renovating process at the school house and four women of us stained shellacked and <unclear/> 150 seats, and the stain which is very volatile just betook its self into-one and I have been so sick since. I got up each morning and did my stunt at the desks and <unclear/> ^to bed in the afternoon. I think I had painter's colic I still have cramps but can eat a little have been living on milk principally. An so sorry to keep you waiting for the fetus. I have been swimming least twice since you left

now we all did miss you. and how we all did enjoy you while you were here. aside from my sickness and lack of swing things are going about the same and I suppose will. We are very busy getting the programme really for the laying of the corner stone. of our new school house, the seats look fine a lot of better than I do since the operation. I am in such a hurry this morning but will surely write you soon again
Much love my dear little girl 
Alice M. Neihardt 
I would suggest that you just leave a place in the diary for me to put my pictures in
