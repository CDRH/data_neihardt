Dear Ones:-
Yesterday P.m on the way to Wayne I saw Mrs. Brown & Ruth for about 3 minutes they asked all about you folks. Ruth had two big red apples for me, and I judge that she polished them all the way to the station! 
Was with Doctor last night. Left there at 2:45 this P.M. couldn't make connection here tomorrow. Will stay here tonight. Leave tomorrow at :45 a.m. for aberdeen. Will arrive at 10:55 P.M. It's 71 miles norht of Soo City-371 South of Omaha. 
I hope everything is all right you. I'll be glad when stay at home. make & peg steadily at the Cycle. I'm glad I can make every <unclear/> <unclear/> <del/> <unclear/>

This way, just the same. 
It seems I never get on a train any more without meeting at least one person I know. Have had good campanions all the way so far. 
Dont forget to mail Journal work on Wednesdays by noon. When I get back to Omaha I'll send some money, for <unclear/>. 
Don't expect individual letters. I'll tell you about Lulu, Mama, when I get back to Omaha. Maybe I can write from Cedar Rapids on Thursdays Kiss the <unclear/> for Dad and thank her every day. 
Lots of love to all of you 
Daddy.
