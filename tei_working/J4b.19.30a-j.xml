February 5, 1943.
Dear Mama,
<p>Here in our little hotel room, each occupied in his own little method of amusement, sit the members of our little troupe! We have had quite a busy day; rehearsing and all, and are now relaxing a bit. Therefore, I am taking this opportunity to write the account of our little automobile accident of nearly three months ago, which you, dear Mutter, requested of me!</p>
<p>It was on the morning of November the 9th</p>

<p>that we were driving along the highway somewhere outside Savannah, Georgia. We had driven thusly all night, but had just stopped fifteen minutes previously at a little trucker's cafe in order to have our breakfasts. Therefore, we felt well fortified enough to continue for the few hours necessary to reach Newport News, Virginia where we were to fulfill our next engagement. How happy we were that morning! I shall never forget the beauty we seemed to <hi rend="underline">feel</hi> as strongly as to <hi rend="underline">see</hi> that morning of mornings. Maybe there</p>

<p>was a presentiment of the <hi rend="underline">nearness</hi> to the other world which we were so soon to experience. Who knows! Anyway, one thing is certain - there was a goodly amount of beauty abroad at the hour and in that picturesque country. All the little draws, as we drove along, were bulging with white, ghostly fog, trees laden with Spanish moss assumed queer shapes in their garments of mist, and just above the horizon rose the sun, a ball of burnished orange. We were unusually peaceful, happy yes, even inspired, that</p>

<p>morning, and were finding joy in talking of the beauty all around us - when something like a nightmare took place. What I now remember, as was what I remembered immediately after the accident is not a clear, ordered description of what actually took place. No, it is rather like a surrealistic painting - a queer conglomeration of pictures and feelings - each of which is clear in itself, but which is strangely dreamlike in its entirety. The severve of horizontaly wooden slats, the feeling of sudden terror, the impact of collision, the crazy zig-zagging of the heavy</p>

<p>Buick in which we rode then nothingness! How easily could we have stayed in that darkness or have come out on the other side of it! Why we awoke here I do not know. The next thing I knew Sylvia was shaking me by the arm saying "Get out, Alice!" "I can't," said I, "I'm pinned in." Actually, the dashboard was caved in so that it practically sat on my lap, and George, at the wheel, was pressed in between the latter and the seat in almost unbelievable fashion. When I got a chance to see Syl</p>

<p>via - my hair fairly stood on end, for her head was covered with blood from top to chin. I got out and crumpled down on the grass (Vaguely, I remember all this) beside the wreck. Soon someone came  to me, picked me up and asked if I was already. I really though I was fine now, for after that first glimpse of my bloody fist with the white, severed tendons protruding from a gaping wound, I forgot my injury almost completely. As we were told afterward by our friends and co-troupers, we were piled at once into our producer's wife's</p>

<p>car and driver eighty miles an hour to the next town, little Ridgeland, So. Car. That ride I scarcely remember - only George's puzzled expression as he muttered dreamily and self-accusingly "But I was driving!", Sylvia's bloody, dazed countenance, and Doris' bunged - upface with the large goose - egg on right temple. We arrived quickly at the hospital, and were led like willing lambs into the small, pleasantly - un hospitalish operating room. There George was laid face up on the white table while his appalling deep, sunken, gash just above the left eye was sewn up. The other victims I could see, and hear, too in various places if the room</p>

<p>while their less-serious <unclear/> were attended to. When at last the doctor came to me (I was sitting on a chair witnessing all this "rehabilitation" - meanwhile thinking suddenly how lucky I was not to have been injured!) he took my hand, examined it carefully and said "Hmm, Looks as if you have the worst cut of all!" I was actually very surprised to hear this, for the nerves had been severed along with the tendon in my hand, and thus I was unable to feel much pain <unclear/> sulfaccilimide (sp?) was put on the wound, and then all of us were sent to bed. There we remained several hours in a state of dopiness due to shock. When at last the doctor came to see us he presented me with another problem. I could have my hand repaired there, but only at the risk of being forced later to repeat the same operation, for tying tendons is a delicate job - one requiring a specialist. There</p>

<p>fore a specialist in Savannah was suggested. I thought it just as well to have the job done at once - for I do hate being a burden and a bother but both Connie (Mrs. Taylor) and George insisted that I go on to Richmond with the rest of the invalids for treatment in the Johnston Willie Hospital there. So it was done! We were dressed around 1:00 oâ€™clock, booked our taxi shortly thereafter, and rode to the train which was to leave at 2:45, Richmond-bound. <hi rend="underline">What</hi> a sight we were! Still stunned, our eyes had that other-wordly stare, and otherwise we closely resembled a troupe of wounded soldiers returning from the front! Our clothes were blood-soaked, and our general appearance confirmed the solider idea most convincingly. In fact, once on the train, that is exactly</p>

<p>what we were told by the hordes of solider-boys riding with us. How marvelously sympathetic they were! Everything within reason was done for our comfort - and we even forgot the increasing pain we were begin to realize, not that the stunned feeling was going. All that afternoon - and all that weary night we rode. There sate Sylvia opposite me, her entire skull covered with a white bandage, in true Pocahontas-style on her forehead!): across from me, George, still a bit weakened by the terrific blow he had received on his head, and next to me, Doris, with eyes that were rapidly turning black and blue. The other girls were with us too, one with a cut nose, and the other with a cut on the nape of her nick. Morning came at last, and we found ourselves in Richmond. There we got out of the train and hurried to a certain hotel in which we were to find rooms. No rooms could be hand, we were informed, for a Medical Convention was in town - and all hotels were filled to overflowing. Doctors, doctors, every</p>

<p>where, but non even looked at us! We sat in that hotel lobby several hours, then breakfasted and went at once to the hospital, where, mercifully, we were attended to almost immediately. Dr. Daniels, who attended to me, came to remove the blood-soaked bandage, and as he did so, I shuddered with the sudden, willing pain I felt. It was as if all my nerves were <unclear/> and all centered there in that hand! So the "twilight sleep" was injected into my arm, and I slept peacefully till the nurse woke me. When I came to again, there was a splint on my arm from tips of fingers to elbow, and I could feel almost nothing for numbness. Thence, I was wheeled upstairs on a white table and placed in a comfortable, high bed next to a gentille,</p>
