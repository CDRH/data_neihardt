Dear Hiddy:
Here is a little money. 
I'm wondering how you are spending this rainy weekend. Everything is going finely here. I'm making good headway on the "Song", Macmillans have asked for the opening pages to be used in a salesman's <unclear/>, and they are including the book in their Spring catalog. I think it will be ready! 
Probably next week and Mama & I will prime up & spend the day with you - second hand stores, movies, etc. 
Be happy - and be first in your classes as son as it can be managed. 
Endless love 
Daddy
