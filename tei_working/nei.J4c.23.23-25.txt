<p>Dear Stewart:</p>

	<p>No doubt you remember the letter I did <hi rend="underline">not</hi> write you in reply to the good letter you 
<hi rend="underline">did</hi> write me? Well, this is that letter - the one I did not write you sooner! I hope everything is now clear! I was very glad to hear from you, and I approve the plan you

-2-

have for spending your money on a copy of my book. If you have the book when I come, I will write in it. I gave your message to Robin, and I believe he will write you. I should think it would be fun for you two to attend school together. Only two weeks from this day Robin and I will be flying to Oregon!</p>

						<p>With affection,</p>
