Wednesday.
Dear Folks:
Guess you are wondering what has become of Alice and me. But we'll try to offer some very good excuses in the way of being lazy and such like things. I felt that Sig had been doing all the writing for us. 
Yesterday was wash day and Alice and I had a nice time to-gether getting it done. Sig got dinner, and what a dinner! Alice and I did justice to it I must say but neither of us felt that we wanted any more for the rest of the day and I'm feeling the same way this morning, food just doens't look so good. 
Alice, Helen, the Waltz girl and I went to the dime show last night. Sig stayed with the kids. Next time Alice will stay and Sig and I will go together, but we thought this time it would be nice to arrange it this way. It was a cute affair--tell Dad we saw his favorite serial, Hi-Ho Silver!! It was no end thrilling, only the hero got into a mess and we will be in suspense until next week to find out what happened to him. It does oneshearts good to see the Hero on his Black Beauty Bicycle (only this time it was a horse) fly to the rescue of his lady fair and save her from a fate worse than death; Ah! Gone are the days of Harold Halatosis, forever! No more on the flickering silver screen will the splendid heroic deeds he performed be seen. Alas! (NUTS)
This morning Grace brought over the wicker couch. It's nice to have it again. Alice and Sig and I will put it up in your room. That is where Grace said you wanted it. 
It has rained so much that it hasn't been necessary to water the little head of Joan. Neither has it been necessary to water the flowers. 
They brought back the rug from the cleaners and it is a little stiff, the nap is, I mean. But he said to sweep it and it would be soft again. He said he always used a wire bruch on the nap before bring-ing a rug back but that someone was cleaning in his place and evidently did-n't know about that. He said if we were not satisfied to let him know. I think it will come out all right. I'll see that it does. 
Alice has been practicing off and on, but feels that she will start in earnest today to get her last two weeks in before she has to return to St. Louis. I do not xx know what arrangements you have made for her clothes, but I take that you mean to see to that when you return. I just wish I was good enough at the machine to make her a few things. I remember you mentioning that you would like to make her a dance suit. 
As soon as the paper comes from Sears the stationary will be ready. After more than a month gone by. Ridiculous!

We have certainly had marvelous weather here. The nights all cool and the days bearable. No great heat. There was only one day that was really hot and that could be stood. 
No doubt Sig told you that the shower broke again. The place where you turn it off broke right in two pieces where a solder job had been done very poorly before. I believe Charlie Hudgins did it. Any-way Sig fixed it up in fine shape and now it works better than before. We have to be careful not to jerk it too hard when we turn it off so the strain will not be too great on the mended part. 
We all hated to see Hilda leave, and she did hate to go so. Sparkey came up and got her and Sig went down with her to stay with her the few minutes she had to wait for the bus. We had a letter from her yesterday saying she had arrived safely and was staying at the Maryfair, or had stayed there the first night she was there. No doubt we will hear again soon as to her definite plans. 
Well, I guess I've said just about all that can be said. That crack about the meals here that Dad made on one of his cards upset me so tha tI feel that I must go and wash the breakfast dishes! Tell him that he musn't say such things, I just might go and do anything awful that came into my head. 
Joan and Elaine are'aful' good and Joan got your card about the pouts, Nanny, and we decided that the pouts had had time to get where you saw them for they hadn't been hanging around here for ever so long. Isn't that nice? Baby 'Laine says to give Gaki a hug for her and to tell him that life just isn't the same when he isn't here for she gets awfully abused and trodden on here. She looks it to, so thin! Her mama played her an awful trick and put thumb stuff on her thumbs of a night and I think it will stop her. It tasts terrible, and I don't see how she could stand to get it into her mouth. 
Well, well, time to stop. So glad everything goes well with you and hope you have a wonderful time at Bison. 
Love, 
Sigurd
