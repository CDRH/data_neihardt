My dear Hilda:
First, you must forgive my tardiness in replying to your request. I am quite terrible that way and I feel thoroughly ashamed of myself. 
Heaven knows where you got the notion that I am one of "the famous writers of our time." Just the same I am glad you think I am. Maybe, if you keep on be-lieving so, I shall some day prove worthy of your praise and vindicate your faith. 
Are you related in any way to my friend, the poet John G. Neihardt: He is a grand person as well as a great poet -- and if you aren't related to him, you ought to find out the reason why. 
Cordially yours, 
Joseph Huslander
