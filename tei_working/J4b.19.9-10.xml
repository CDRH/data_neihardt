This was right after I left the P.D. The 8th Dist. Fed protested etc.

Saturday Noon.
Dearest Old Ladies:
<p>Mama is sending a letter, so I'll send mine now with the maguma.</p>
<p>We're happy about all the good we hear from and about both of you. Wish we could have seen the ballet. But we will sometimes.</p>
<p>Did Enot and Ollie tell you about the protests that went in to Pulitzer and Rose lately, and have the former asked Fay Proflet to prepare a report on the Eight Dis. Fed. with 10 000 members? Maybe they'll "approach" me. I'm fairly approchable for editing here, with Enot there - but I'm not eager. The lecture outlook is excellent &amp; getting excellenter. Also, I'm surging on with "Jed". Fourteen lines a day very often, and no less than ten for a long while! It's fun!</p>
<p>Am getting a portable workshop assemble all on one small table for gem &amp; jewelry work. Will get going pretty soon, &amp; have some beautiful things planned.</p>
<p>By the way, after "Jed", the next - Thing poem will be "A Catalog of Beautiful <unclear type="cut_off"/></p>

<p>Note the new word in the title.</p>
<p>I'll play with the pem - really a series of lyric flights - and it will be a pleasure.</p>
Endless love,
Dad.
