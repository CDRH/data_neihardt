Dearest Children
<p>You <sic>cant</sic> Know how much good your drive to have us with you has done us. In fact the future looks far less sad because of it.</p>
<p>Everything is fine here. Joanie is all over the homesick spell she had just before going to sleep the first night when she wanted her Mama. She says she doesnt' see why her Mama has to stay in the city! She wishes her Mama could be here too! Bless her heart. She is a darling. I wish all of us could be <underline>some</underline> place together instead of so separated.</p>
<p>Dearest children please let this note tell you all it should as I have nothing new to say.</p>
Endless love to you both
from Mama Mother.
