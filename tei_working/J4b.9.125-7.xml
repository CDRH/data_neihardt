Sweetheart,
Here I am, up early again & will answer a few questions which I have neglected to!
I played the Ab-valse, two Larks, ^do Song without words - at Springfield! 
Here in Fulton it was a hard job to keep the girls off of me! I sat at the piano & they flocked a round requesting certain numbers etc! til I tho't I'd die! (Girls and boy's school you know.) I had a 10 ft. 5-in. Baldwin Concert Grand - brand new & I did better'n ever before! H. Yandell was there had a nice time with him - and other fellows!

Pres. Cockrell's son is a very fine fellow & is so genuinely interested in everything! You know how I mean!
Certainly had a big success here at Fulton - large crowd!
This is a letter to let you know what is ahead of me today! Have been asked so kindly by Miss Burr & the girls to play more, for them at 1000 A.M; so will have to do so!
Really haven't the time cause I must be in K.C. no by 3:00 P.M. C? 
Gee! What a day! 

I'll be glad when I get to the place where I'll receive another sweet letter from you - my dear girl!! Please forgive me for not being able to get out & see the moon at 8:55-9:05 - because I've been occupied at those hours - & much against my desire! Hope your father is better, & that you are taking care of yourself! 
Has Curran had a spell of strength & being up & around yet - as the medium told me? 
No missin' of kisses - even in the dark, sweet girl-'cause we've become "accurate"! Ha! Ha! 
I love you always, & am miserable without you, 
Your Sig.
