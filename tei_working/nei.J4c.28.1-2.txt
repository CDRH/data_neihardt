Dear Edna:

	Thanks for telling me about Elmer. When I knew him, he was the very little brother of John, and he did not knock around with us. I've reached the time when the people of my old world have mostly gone on, and the others are going faster and faster. It's quite all right<sic>alright</sic> - it has to be! But it's an increasingly lonely business.
	I'm busy at the University on Tuesdays and Thursdays with 1 1/2 hour classes. I have 176 in my Epic America class,

-2-

the largest thus far, after 12 years. Happily, I have a grader and roll-keeper, so that I have only to give the lecture. 
<hi rend="underline">Only</hi>! It's talking to an auditorium for 1 1/2 hours. Do you have a phonograph? If so, I've thought you might care to have a record of my reading from <hi rend="underline">A Cycle of the West</hi>. Do you know the 
<hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>? I think of you and Hugh and John very often. 

	With affectionate thoughts for each of you, <signature>John Neihardt</signature>

P. S. I've had the whole interior of my house on the farm ("Skyrim") re-decorated. Two decorators worked nearly two weeks on the job, and they nearly broke me!! But the place is rather beautiful. I had it done the way I know Mona (Mrs. N.) would want it done. This may seem silly, but I'm not sure it is. I'll move in out there on May 1st. My granddaughter wants the job of living with me &amp; keeping house!

				Affectionately
