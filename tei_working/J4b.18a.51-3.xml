Precious Alice:
<p>We are thrilled and made happy by your letters, and the latest is a joy! Golly, young lady, you are certainly on the wing! it's all quite bully, and we're so glad about it. We know you'll keep your head, for you are that sort of person. If we could only sit out there with the groudlingo and match you four!</p>
<p>-And the extra money!</p>
<p>Amama left yesterday. There was <underline>no</underline> discard, altho' plenty of discords could have been! Some weeks before she left, it became cleaar that she felt <underline>free</underline>, and she said as much. Poor Amama! It's</p>
52
<p>a case of the "short-circuit" about white I wrote you.</p>
<p>We had a truly happy summer - and her <underline>goodness</underline> did come out. If she could only <underline>understand</underline>, how precious she could be!</p>
<p>I think of you first, naturally, but next I think of you four together - and love you all together.</p>
Endless love, 
Dad.
