<p>Dear Dr. Aly:</p>

	<p>During the past three days I have been hungrily reading your <hi rend="underline">Hamilton</hi> - a fine experience; and I am most grateful to you. I wish you had put your name on the fly-leaf<sic>flyleaf</sic>; but perhaps you will do so next summer.</p>
	<p>Surely the man emerges clearly from the pages of your book, and I am richer for knowing him better than before. Mrs. Aly remarked that I am a Hamiltonian, and I know what 

                                                 <hi rend="underline">over</hi>

was what was the matter with me when I was a Socialist. It has been the same with me in the conception of all values, from those of common sense up through esthetics, ethics, religion.</p>
	<p>You've done a lot of good, Aly. Many thanks!</p>

                                                <p>Your friend,</p>
