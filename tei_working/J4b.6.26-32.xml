My Dear little girl-
Maybe you have gotten the thots that have been going you-ward for a long time and if you have you are not surprised that no letter has gone your way for so long; I really dont' remember what Ihave told you of my winter's trip and I know you are just now finding out that I am home again I have not been well. For the last year and a half.

chicken yard is just one big bank loaded with buds - then there are dozens of bush roses, loaded with blossoms oh how I wish you could see them, the yard is so pretty my garden is late but we have had peas and new potatoes since the first of May-then I must not forget to tell you about my strawberry bed - we had such beasts of strawberries every way.
