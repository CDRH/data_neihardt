<salute>Dear John:</salute>
</opener>

<p>In going through my desk, your letter of Oct. 1957 &#8212; was found &amp; Ive read it with much pleasure.</p>

<p>I'm 74 and find that with age &#8212; my memories are very much in evidence. A trip to the Rosebud Reservation when I was 16 &#8212; the stage from Valentine to Rosebud (35 mi.) with a stopover at "The Half Way House" &#8212; and a stay with the Indian Agent there whose children had attended NNC &#8212; as well as several 1/2 breeds whose fathers were government civil service!! Seeing a "beef issue" &#8212; that occurred every 15 days &#8212; and each Indian had to be indentified &#8212; how amusing it was to hear the interpreter call out "Mrs. Spotted Tail #2" etc. etc.!!</p>

<p>And, John, did you know about the wonderful Indian discoveries in the 1930&#8212;1936 - at St. James, Nebraska? Professor Bell, of Nebraska Uni. wrote

<pb/>

it up and when Fred &amp; I took mothers ashes to Wayne in 1937 &#8212; we went to see that and the farmer (his wife was a former student) let us prowl around &amp; the artifacts &amp; reconstruction was so very interesting.
</p>

<p>When I read so much these days about bigotry etc. &amp; I never heard the word Jew or felt any difference in way the Indians who attended our school were so different! And father had cooks make a second Sunday breakfast for Catholics who went downtown to early mass!</p>

<p>All that rushes thru my mind and I think its a fine occupation for an old lady to have memories that keep her from feeling lonely.</p>

<p>My lovely grandaughter (17) is in college at Iowa Wesleyan in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa &#8212; her folks were there on Parent Day (Oct. 8) and she is happy &amp; becoming adjusted. My son is

with Standard Oil of Indiana &#8212; in Employee Relations &#8212; head of division of Job Analysis &#8212; and his offices are in their Executive Bldg in Chgo.</p>

<p>This village is 2 1/2 miles from Evanston, 14 miles from center of Chicago &#8212; &amp; has grown from 14,000 when I came here 11 years ago to over 58,000 now. Excellent schools &amp; quiet environment.</p>

<p>Please give my affectionate regard to Mrs. Mona &amp; to you &#8212; best of all good wishes &#8212; from</p>

<postscript><p>P.S. I wish I were near enough for you to read two very interesting books of Connecticut History &#8212; One is "Documetary History of Suffield in the Colony &amp; Province of the Massachusetts Bay, in New England 1660-1749 only 250 copies printed and contains town records etc &#8212; &amp; is the most complete record of early settlers I've ever read.</p>
<p>The second is a pamphlet Title is "Suffield and the Lexington Alarm" in April 1775</p>

<p>Suffield Conn. is a town midway beterrn Hartford Conn &amp; Springfield, Mass &#8212; and my husband was born there &amp; all the family heirlooms came to him as last male of family &amp; now  son Richard is last of the line so we have so many things of Colonial times. Your Mona would enjoy seeing a large oil Portrait painted in 1837 of "Uncle Joel" Newton &#8212; a chaplain in the Navy. You know John, I've never know much 'old' history as far as Nebraska was concerned &amp; to be "dumped" into all that was a bit startling at first. I'm closing &amp; excuse my rambling &#8212; affectionately, Helen</p>
