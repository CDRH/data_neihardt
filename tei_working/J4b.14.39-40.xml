My Own Mona: 
Those were precious letters that arrived by special delivery yesterday. and yours was full of light. I haven't been feeling so hot since Friday but the trouble is subsiding and I'll be fine soon. It was only a nagging sort of discomfort, and so didn't matter much. I'll see the Doc at 2:30 P.m, tomorrow, and perhaps I'll get away Wed. A.Mx certainly I'm eager to beat home with you all. I'll drive carefully - as tho I were precious; and I am if I'm needed.
