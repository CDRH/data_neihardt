Dear Dr. Neihardt: 
On behalf of my students , may I say that we thoroughly enjoyed your poems and thoughts. 
I don't know whether you are aware of the term "happening" or not, but we all felt tha tlast night was a "happening" in our lives. 
For the past several years I have been a student of the Nebraska history. Both you and Mari Sandoz have breathed a special meaning into mortal man's kinship with nature - in fact, the total oneness of all life that springs from the land or the cosmos to be more precise. Although most of us will never experience that oneness which you and Miss Sandoz shared, we can at least wonder about the great spirit-ual and terrestrial communion you shared and which you gave to us through your works. 
Thank you again, Dr. Neihardt, for an unforgettable evening. 
Respectfully yours, 
Max Poole
