I picked up a gorgeous - carved jade ring for Mama in K.C. the jade is 2 inches long, and the gold finally chased.

Dear Enot and Ollie:
I'm coming out of the fog again with Jed, and that's a glorious feeling. It's too soon yet, Enot, to read the thing aloud, except to Mama, as so much depends on the developing wood-of-the-whale. But already there is much. I thought "Jed" would be easier than the others; but it isn't. They're all alike in difficulty. Only now I have the dynamic inner pattern of the piece, and it thrills me. 
We're going to Springfield today - the whole nation of us; so I'll not write much. But I want to say that I'm not fooling about that ivory mounsting for the amethyst. It goes on & chemming itself while I'm doing other things, and I believe it will be half finished when I get my hands on another piece of ivory. It will be more beautiful than a gold setting - and unique. Mama's ivory ring with the card cameo is really impressive, and I made a little jade ring of ivory for Max, this is only practice for a more ambitious setting of the amethyst - for my secretary extraordinary, bless her! 
Ollie, you old cuss, I want to look at you over a beer bottle! 
Endless love, 
Dad 
I've just set a yellow sapphire in a nice lapis lazuli <unclear/> for a breast pin. (over)

Recently I made an iron-wood frame-wanting for a shell cameo - another pin for Mama. 
God, but iron wood is a cranky cuss to work! Hard as a chippy's heart! But it polishes.
