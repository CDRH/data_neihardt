Dear folks:
<p>I thought it might be a good idea to drop you another note at Bison. We all wrote you there, but the letter was fairly heavy &amp; I feared insufficient postage. Joan &amp; Elaine are so good. I found out what makes Joanie cry at mealtime. Apparently she wants to help-herself to things as the other people do. She's not cried at the table since the new system of feeling has begun. It has been unusually hot &amp; muggy here. I hope you will not be forced to hurry up your vacation.</p>
<p>We are all well &amp; happy, &amp; delighted over the fact that you &amp; Mom are enjoying your trip. My right arm is <underline>splendid</underline> once more. So, now it is practically certain that teeth were the source of it all.</p>
Lots of Loce from all, Sig.
