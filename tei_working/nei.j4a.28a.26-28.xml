<salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
</opener>

<p>Although you have not heard from me in some time, this does not mean you have been forgotten, neither does it mean that my writing has slowed down. Quite the contrary &#8212; on both counts. Unfortunately, I lost about nine months as the result of a heard injury sustained in an accident, but I have worked fiercely with a determination such as I never dreamed was possible in order to recover the use of my vision as well as my memory. Rejoice with us, Doctor, recovery is complete with the exception of a blank period of about eight weeks during which I was semi-conscious. However, none of this matters now that it is over.</p>

<p>Some time ago I was invited to join the membership of the National Writers Club. This has helped immeasurably. I am taking advantage of every privilege accorded members whenever possible, and believe it or not, it has been quite an education. The council is most helpful.</p>

<p>Since you were one of the first people to see and appraise any of my prose, I took the liberty of using your name as a literary reference when I applied to the Eugene F. Saxton Memorial Trust for a fellowship. The prose project submitted is a long one which cannot be complete without financial assistance. This

<pb/>

try for a fellowship means a great deal to all of us. The chance, of course, is a long one, but anything worth working for is certainly worth the effort as well as the risk. Do not fear, losing out will not discourage me, because I know I have something really worth while, and I am not afraid of hard work and study.</p>
	<p>We talk of you now and then, dear friend. We still hope for the day when Willard and the boys can meet you in person. Our plan for a trip into the Ozarks fizzled, but we did take a brief vacation in the wilderness of southeastern Ontario last July. The experience which we shared together was a deep and stirring one. This was our first vacation away from home in fourteen years of marriage. However, no other could have been more complete. </p>

<p>With best of wishes to you and yours,</p>
