My dear Friend,
I got the record of your poetry yesterday. This morning's Kansas City Star has the lovely story of your life and once more I am proud to recall all your kindness to me. You are a great man, Dr. Neihardt. God bless you for you goodness. 
I am still teaching my young men here at Conception Seminary. Friday of this week my American Literature class will read your poetry and hear the recordings which thrilled me yesterday. I'm also going to be vain enough to take to class the seven letters I have received from you! It will 

YOU ALSO SHALL LIVE.

be a good day! 
I send sincere greetings and good wishes to you. Never will I forget the lovely Sunday afternoon at Mt. Marty College in Yankton. With kindest thoughts,
