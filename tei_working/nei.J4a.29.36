Dear Professor Neihardt:
<p>Pursuant to the instructions of the Board of Directors of The Academy of American Poets, Inc., I call your attention to the vacancies now existing in the membership of the Board of Chacellors, due to the resignation on January 9, 1961 of Dr. Henry S. Canby for reasons of ill health, and the expiration of Dr. Robert Hillyer's term on that same date.</p>
<p>Dr. Canby has served since 1946 when he was elected to the Original Board having been re-elected in 1953, and Dr. Hillyer was elected in 1949.</p>
<p>Two nominating blanks are enclosed. Please note that you have the right to nominate two persons for each of these vacancies. Kindly date and sign the nomination blanks and return them to me at your earliest convenience. Nominations will be closed on March 7, 1961.</p>
<p>It will be helpful if you would indicate briefly the reasons which motivate your nominations.</p>
<p>The present Board of Chancellors and the pertinent provisions of the Charter and By-Laws governing the election of Chancellors are enclosed herewith. Chancellors may be re-elected as often as desired.</p>
Very truly yours,
