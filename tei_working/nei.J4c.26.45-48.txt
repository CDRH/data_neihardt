Dear Lucile:

	<p>Yours of the 9th must have stopped off for a visit along the way! Anyway, I have it. I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> want to come at the time stated, but I'm troubled about Bower being gone. I wrote him, as he'll tell you, of course. I assumed you meant Washington, <hi rend="underline">D. C.</hi>, but it has just struck me you may have meant the <hi rend="underline">state</hi>!  (over)

I'd feel happier if I knew I'd at least <hi rend="underline">see</hi> Bower and have a talk.</p> 
	<p>This year I've solved the Xmas problem by earmarking (this has a <unclear>!) by earmarking (I 
<hi rend="underline">love</hi> the expression!) $5.00 for each of my numerous children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, <hi rend="underline">and</hi> honorary grandson. So I'm sending you a check and asking you to be Santa Claus for me and see that old Judge Aly has a little remembrance from Gaki.

If I could (and I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> want to come) I'll find my way down from Portland. You should not make that long drive. I enclose the letter from Rex Carey's nephew. Note the marked paragraph. Rex greatly enjoyed his correspondence with you. He sent me some things that he asked me to send on to you. I'll either send or  bring them. I'll write soon again.</p> 

				<p>Affection to each of you, including Gamby.</p>   <signature>John</signature>   (over)


P. S. 

	<p>Old Robin says that's a nice answer, Stewart, but <hi rend="underline">not</hi> the right one. The following, he insists, <hi rend="underline">is correct</hi>:
If two's a company and three's a crowd, four and five is <hi rend="underline">nice</hi>! He is willing to fight, bleed (copiously, and die a little), for the the correctness of his answer. - Gaki.</p>
