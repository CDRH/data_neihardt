Dear Dr. Neihardt: 
I would like to take this opportunity to express my gladness upon learning of your recent honor of being named Epic Poet of America. I am confident that I speak for the entire University English De-partment faculty and English graduate student population when I say that the honor was well deserved. Certianly, there have been few if any artists in the history of English Literature that have given as large a contribution to the arts. Your almost three-quarters of a century of contributions stand as a monument to your-self as a man and to your creative abilities as an artist. 
As a student of literature, I was also gratified to learn that you are currently engaged in recording some of your works. Myself and future students will benefit greatly from these recordings. It is my sincere hope that by being designated as Epic Poet of America and by the recordings soon to be released that the American public will begin to recognize the significance of your great epic work, A Cycle of the West. It is certainly a work that has for too long been deprived of the respect and attention that it so justly deserves. 
Once again my heartfelt congratulations. 
My best regards,
Brent A. Warren
