Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>On behalf of the students of Southeast High School, student council would like to extend their sincere appreciation for you giving up your time to come and speak to us. We are sure your message inspired all and realize how important literature is to our education. Both assemblies communicated well with the student body, and we are grateful for this.</p>
<p>Thank you once again.</p>
Sincerely
Jane Edstrom
