Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>This is not a bid for continued correspondence but I certainly want to thank you for your courteous reply to my other letter. Mrs. Young had also written to me while you were in the hospital and I had not actually expected an answer from either of you. I know your time must be very limited. I do wish it was possible to visit you personally and perhaps it might be at some time.</p>
<p>I want to thank you especially for explaining the verse form used in the CYCLE. I don't see how it would permit itself being read without the proper pauses, the lines fall so naturally into place but the rhyming of each two lines had me puzzled as I was under the impression that this was what a couplet was. I knew that all the other couplet type poems I had read would not have done for an epic poem; the choppy sound would have become monotonous in the extreme. I know when a poem sounds right--at least I think I do--but my education is sadly lacking as to the whys and wherefores that make it right. And no matter what technique you used I still feel it must be very difficult to use that rhyme throughout such long poetry.</p>
<p>Also I could never sustain the proper rhythm for so long. You are absolutely right about it adding to the meaning of the lines. At least it does for me.</p>
<p>I have been trying to write poetry at odd moments --very odd ones-- for several years and if I should ever come close to doing one I felt was really good I would be as happy as I have ever hoped to be. You are right in another thing, you did write your poetry for me.</p>
<p>Thank you again and God bless you.</p>
Sincerely,
