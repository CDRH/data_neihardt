Dearest Mom &amp; Dad:-
<p>I hope you know I've been thinking of you <underline>very often</underline>! I've been canning &amp; jellying lately. Fri. or Sat. I'll put up the first of our tomatoes. So far I have 46 qts. str. beans &amp; 10 qts. chald, a shelf of jelly, &amp; hope to get a lot of tomatoes now. So far, in figuring skimpily, our garden has netted us $20.00 in groceries! We're beginning to have corn now - &amp; <underline>is it good</underline>!</p>
<p>Mon., would you <unclear/> time to make Nei a coat &amp; little cap for this winter if I send material &amp; pattern? If not, please say so, won't you?</p>
<p>Isn't a lot of news now. But we're all well &amp; happy &amp; know you three are. Give Amama our love &amp; ask her to write us.</p>
<p>Nei attended his first birthday party yesterday. Deanna Mai Kramer was 1 yr. old! He was <underline>so good</underline>! And was the youngest one there!!</p>
<p>We send our love in bushel baskets to you &amp; Dad &amp; lots o' love to Amama!</p>
Always, Enid
<p>Write soon.</p>
