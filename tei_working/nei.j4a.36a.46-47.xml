                    <salute>Dear Gaki:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I received your letter this morning, M<del>e</del><add>y</add>rtle, for which I certainly thank you. I don't know how our letters got in Gaki's suitcase.</p>
                
                <p>I am sending today the clothing, the dog chain, the dog medicine left here. I di<del>n</del><add>d</add>n't want to send the clothing items back to you dirty, M<del>e</del><add>y</add>rtle.</p>
                
                <p>Now for the big <del>C</del><add>K</add>urland-Cavett matter. I telephoned Dick Cavett today. He was already in the studio, so I spoke to Doris Wilke, his private secretary, whose name Dick had given to us. I told her of the telephone call from <del>C</del><add>K</add>urland and explained that we were disinchanted<sic>disenchanted</sic> with <del>C</del><add>K</add>urland and that we preferred just to let our option agreement die on November 13.</p>
            
                <p>Doris was very interested to know what exactly <del>C</del><add>K</add>urland had told me, because she said that she did not think much of him and that she felt sure that Dick had not made any such agreement with <del>C</del><add>K</add>urland. Really, I am sure that you felt this was the truth, as did I. Anyway, it was a good thing to telephone. Doris understood the situation perfectly and told me that she would speak to Dick at the earliest possible moment, no doubt today, and if there was any reply, she would call me.</p> 
                
                <p>I told Doris Wilke that we have received several other inquireies from persons who have more to recommend them than did <del>C</del><add>K</add>urland, and if Dick became interested in investing in a Black Elk movie, we would be just delighted.</p> 
                
                <p>I went down to your lock box at noon, Gaki, and took out the agreement which you signed with the University of Missouri. I am sending you a copy of it herewith. You will notice that it provides that the transfer of your manuscripts, as well as the transfer of your library, is a gift to the Univeristy of Missouri.</p>
                
                <p>Please do not be overly upset by this fact, because there may be a possibility the University of Missouri would cooperate with us on the Nebraska project. I will be very pleased to look into this matter with the University attorney, if you authorize me to do so.</p>
                
                <p>About the <hi rend="underline">Lyric and Dramatic Poems</hi>. The contract with the University of Nebraska provides that they <add><hi rend="caps">MAY</hi></add> discontinue any item which does not sell enough to warrant their continuing with it. It further provides that if they don't publish for a period

                    of six months, you may withdraw your agreement to them. I will get in touch with Mr. Nicol<add>l</add> and see what the problem is.</p> 
                
                <p>We did learn a lot about <del>your</del><add><hi rend="caps">THE</hi></add> movie situation in general through our Black Elk experiences. I think that it is not at all too late, and the recent tremendous sales of the book will be a help. As you know, we have three people who are waiting to discuss a possible Black Elk movie, and there may well be others.</p> 
                
                <p>I hope that all of you are well and that you, Gaki, are steadily improving. It was such a pleasure to have you with us, and we hope that you and M<del>e</del><add>y</add>rtle and <hi rend="caps">J.D.</hi> will come back some time later this fall.</p>
