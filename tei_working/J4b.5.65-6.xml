My Dear little girl; 
Such pleasant thots fill me this morning because they surround you. The pleasant times and the happy days you spent with me I so long to have repeated. You know 
my dear you are my ideal and when ever I want to compare to someone worth while it is, "Just like Miss Piper." My dear this is carrying to you good cheer for christmas and best wishes for the New Years with love Alice McNeihardt
