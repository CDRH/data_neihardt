Dearest Mama:
<p>We have had a very enjoyable trip. Max is seeing a lot of gorgeous sights in the appalachian Mts. Are being entertained here at Dr. Vining's. They, as you know, were close friends of J.T. House. We saw Dr.'s grave today out at Cedar Grove. The piano here is a lovely Concert grand Baldwin &amp; all is in fine shape for the program. Dad met with classes this A.M. He says tell you that all goes well. He is in good health &amp; we're so glad about this.</p>
<p>Hope you have the radio soon.</p>
Endless love for you &amp; kids,
Sig &amp; M. &amp; D.
SPEEDED TO YOU
