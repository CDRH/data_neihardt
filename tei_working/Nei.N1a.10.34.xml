Dear Dr. Neihardt:
Your broadcast on Channel 7 last nigth was truly magnificient. 
I was especially emotionally inspired listening to your description of the agony of Crazy Horse. You are a wonderful man Dr. Neihardt and I am so pleased that our country now has a star in the firmament of American literature who grows in brilliance each passing day. 
Cordially,
