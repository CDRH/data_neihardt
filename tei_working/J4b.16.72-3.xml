Lake Watauga lies at the foot of the beautiful terrace in Centennial Park which is crowned by the classic Parthenon said to be a <underline>perfect replica</underline> of the famous Parthenon of ancient Greece. The lack was named in honor of the first settlers of Tennessee, who were known as the Watauaga or Cumberladn settlers. They came to Tennessee in 1769, before the State was admitted to the Union.

Lovely Joan:
<p>This is a nice short letter to tell you we are all well and how are you? Do you still know your letters? Is George still a good dog? Do you go walking in the pasture with your tiny sister?</p>
Love from Gaki
<p>Take good care of Nanny and Mama.</p>
