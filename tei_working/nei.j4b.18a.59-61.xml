<underline>Sat</underline>. (This is an abbreviation for Saturday. I use it to save space.)
Dear Ollie:
<p>Many thanks for your note and the ten! My letter was mailed before yours was received, as you will have guessed. I can use five more Samoloans. (This is a colloquial expression, meaning hule, mazuna, holy wafers, and the like. I use it to save space and paper for our war effort.) I need that many more rocks for the house payment on Sep. 13. Otherwise, we are lousy rich.</p>
<p>Nothing from Kemper yet. May hear today - negatively. There are a couple of other chances that may be better. If I can get enough to keep your budget at least normal, I'll be quite happy up there with you three, for I have something I want to do before anoother Spring.</p>
(More litrachoor on the other side.)

<p>This is the other side to which I referred on the other side, but it is now this side and the other side is the other side.</p>
<p>I often have a <strike/> sudden longing to hug old Nei! Hot doo! Jedditch!</p>
<p>Mama &amp; I are working and a little scheme that may keep us a week or ten days more. Katie Mayden loves old Doc and will take him to raise. I wish you could know Doc. he is as fine a person as I know, and he makes everyone love him. Really, he's god soemthing.</p>
<p>I think I can arrange a pay-gas ride to St. Louis. I'll try.</p>
Love to all Three
Dad.
<p>The Rolfo visit was a joy all around. Richard Crowder &amp; another fine young fellow visit us often, and we enjoy them too!</p>
