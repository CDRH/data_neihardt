I was mighty glad to get into the strait of Juan de Fuca after two days. & two nights of pitching & rolling. The waves came up over the rail like green & white leopards. Magnificent, but O Lord the sagging of the universe! No one on board was well but the crew & a few old timers. 
I've been sending <unclear/> afer articles home. Keep them. Have not yet seen the San Francisco Bulletin interview Town Talk is the

society paper of the Bay cities. I didn't know I'd be quoted as to "feeling like a stewed <unclear/> etc". But it's all right. You'll receive the Bulletin interview soon. 
Love to all
Jno. 
I want to see all of you, & you may tell the Wubs that Papa misses them tremendously. But Daddy will soon be home. this is no letter. I'm tired. Have ridden 3 days & nights on a rough sea & 36 hours on a rough train at one fell swoop. 
Jno. 
So glad to yet your letters. Expected more at Carmel. Was somewhat disappointed, but of course there isn't much happening there.
