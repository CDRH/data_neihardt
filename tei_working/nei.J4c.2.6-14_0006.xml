my work. After those who <unclear> were quite as ridiculous to me as those who generously warmed the reader that I was still at large and very much to be shunned. Almost no one now writing "criticisms" in America knows anything about poetry, because it takes long, hard, patent study to at the fundamental laws. This is a quick-lunch time. Advertisements offer to make musicians in a week-<unclear> while you wait! There is even a book <unclear> to teach poetry - the art of writing poetry - to any comer! There seems to be a nation abroad that everyone is faking, and that to appear is the only thing. But time shall devour the fakes. There is no cause for worry.
