<p>Dear Mrs. Aly:</p>

	<p>That <hi rend="underline">was</hi> a good letter - yours of the 9th received only yesterday. (It's a long way out there!)</p>
	<p>You certainly hit the bull's eye when you pointed out that my world-view<sic>worldview</sic> is 
<hi rend="underline">both</hi> Aristotelian and Platonic. That is why I wrote 
<hi rend="underline">Poetic Values</hi> - to show that there is <hi rend="underline">no gap between the two</hi>, that our scale of values

-2-

is continuous. All our values, from "lowest" to "highest" - from common sense through science and on through the esthetic, the ethical, the religious values <hi rend="underline">are obviously</hi> creations in consciousness from selected data of our experience. It is commonly assumed, without assumption, that our 
<hi rend="underline">sense values</hi> are "objective" and therefore "real". But they are created in consciousness too.	

-3-

Surely, nothing in the "sense world" is essentially as we conceive it. The <hi rend="underline">physicists back us 100% in this view</hi>, as I showed 36 years ago in <hi rend="underline">Poetic Values</hi>; and since then they have become more and more obviously supporters of that view. In brief, this is what happens, as I've set forth in <hi rend="underline">Poetic Values</hi>;         

-4-

<hi rend="underline">C. S. science</hi> <hi rend="underline">alleged gap</hi> 
<hi rend="underline">The "higher" values</hi>       

The horizontal line represents the state of consciousness in which the values at any point are 
<hi rend="underline">conceived</hi>. It is commonly, and <hi rend="underline">wrongly</hi>, supposed that there is only <hi rend="underline">one valid state of awareness</hi> - the sense state of common sense and science. If this were true, there would be no art, no religion, no sense of beauty, <hi rend="underline">no love</hi>.

-5-

<hi rend="underline">C. S. science</hi> <hi rend="underline">The "poetic", creative values</hi> 
<hi rend="underline">no gap, only an expansion of the state of awareness, a rising in level</hi>   

Proceeding left to right, the consciousness arrives at a point where the preconception of "the world" as <hi rend="underline">solid</hi>, "objective" fades out. The consciousness expands, is aware of larger relations, and out of this state (and higher ones) <hi rend="underline">creates the values pertinent to such a state or states</hi> and the process is the

-6-

same essentially as that by which the "lower" more restricted values are conceived.</p>
	<p>Perhaps you will read <hi rend="underline">Poetic Values</hi> with this sketch in view. This is <hi rend="underline">not Idealism</hi> in Bishop Berkeley's sense at all! It <hi rend="underline">is</hi> obvious when one comes to think it. I know from my own experience that it is so. The expanded view of "the world" illuminates and gives meaning to the narrower, "lower" view.

-7-

I allowed myself to tell you about my athletic leanings in youth, because they were concerned with a vital part of the scale. And the same excess vitality that operated on the lower levels, has continued to operate on the higher levels - <hi rend="underline">even now</hi>. It is all one pattern. Even what I called the happy "hell-raising" in the good <hi rend="underline">April</hi> days with John Chaffee has its place in the

-8-

scheme of becoming. In considering my <hi rend="underline">worldview</hi> as expressed in various ways throughout my life and my work, I think you are sure to note that there is, in the last analysis, no discrepancy. The 
<hi rend="underline">parts fit</hi> into one pattern. And I suspect that your biography will trace that 
<hi rend="underline">becoming</hi> and the shaping of the pattern. I am still working on the pattern, slowly fitting it to some larger pattern of which I am becoming more more aware.</p>

-9-

	<p>I will read the Poetics and comment modestly, I hope, in keeping with my own experience in that realm. His "melos, lexis, opsis" click with me already! And Plato's cave! Indeed, I know the inside of it very well. Also, I have often found the way out <hi rend="underline">through</hi> the <hi rend="underline">poetic miracle</hi> and also prayer. <hi rend="underline">Poetic Values</hi> explains this also.</p>
	<p>As I remember now, the Albers Bureau was not concerned with a lecture trip for me, but with the possible management

-10-

of a scheme concocted by a brilliant and capable friend. He proposed to run a sort of school on wheels - a special train touring the country, with specialists to lecture to the travelling<sic>traveling</sic> students on numerous matters, geographic, social, artistic, pertaining to the regions visited. This <hi rend="underline">almost</hi> succeeded. <hi rend="underline">I</hi> was willing to give myself to the scheme, did what I could, and enlisted a number of prominent people willing to help. My friend

-11-

ended by committing suicide. I never knew why, but the trouble seemed to be with his wife. He never let me know. I wish he had.</p>
	<p>Feakins <hi rend="underline">lost</hi> me on a Pacific tour, and I quit him to go to Long.
	I enclose a clipping on Stephens. You will know I am quoted with less than accuracy! But 
<hi rend="underline">the intention is much</hi>. Also I enclose a note on the <hi rend="underline">Law Wives'</hi> talk.</p>

-12-

	<p>I'm glad you will see John  Chaffee. He may be of help. He should.</p>

				<p>Kindest thoughts from us to you dear people</p>

	<p>Have you rec'd the recording from Sandy? His address is:
		555 Gayley,
                 Apt. H
              Los Angeles 24.

 The Feakins connection was quite unsatisfactory to <hi rend="underline">both of us</hi>. It was not important, except at the moment. He did not work for me, and he lost me on the tour.</p>
