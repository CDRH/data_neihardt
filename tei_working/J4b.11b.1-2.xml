Dear Enot:
I was about to write one of the many letters I've thought at you; but now this is only a note to say I'm genuinely delighted to know you're coming home. It has all been good, and I am very glad. In one way or another everything will work out reasonably well. 
Endless love, old Enot-Peanot! 
Dad, 
Love to Amama. 
I wish you'd arrange to see Latham. <del>before you</del> Please <del>start</del> do. He's there now.
