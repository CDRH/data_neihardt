                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>When your appearance on the Dick Cavett show was re-run, I broke my usual sleep patterns to enjoy every minute of it. Had I known of it in time the year before, I'd have seen both. - I also enjoyed talking with the Rhines about their visit to you in Columbia. I had not known of it at the time.</p> 
                
                <p>Your Creative Writing class in the University was a happy and useful experience for <add>^me</add> back in 1959. It was then that I started writing my <hi rend="caps">SONNETS OF EVE</hi>. A reason for my writing now and for my not writing immediately after the Dick <del>V</del><add>C</add>avett show is that the <hi rend="caps">SONNETS</hi> were then in the hands of a publisher. They have now been accepted for publication by Moore Publishing Company of Durham, <hi rend="caps">N. C.</hi>, and the book will come out in early spring. I shall certainly send you a copy. There are eighty of the sonnets <del>now</del>, plus a prologue (in b<del>k</del><add>l</add>ank verse printed as prose) and an epilogue (s<del>i</del><add>o</add>nnet). Thirty-five of the sonnets are Petrarchan, twenty-one Shakespearian, and twenty-five are "Flora Rima," the form that I had already originated when I was in your class. It divides nine-five instead of eight-six, and the rhyme scheme is abacbcdcdeefff.</p>
                
                <p>Actually I am not now at the above address but shall be in a little more than a week. The last of April I came to Durham as a visitor and volunteer worker at <hi rend="caps">FRNM</hi> and the Institute for Parapsychology. I get to sign my name "An assistant to Dr. Rhine<del><hi rend="caps">W</hi></del><add>"</add> when I write answers to letters of certain kinds. Most of my time is my own, and that accounts for my being able to type the <hi rend="caps">SONNETS OF EVE</hi> and get them to a publisher. - Even after they were accepted I was awakened at <del>#</del><add>3</add> a.m. one morning and 5 a.m. another to write two that demanded to be written. I pulled out two, with no regrets, but could not make myself eliminate more. No doubt some are not on a par with the best, but all have a truth to tell.</p> 
                
                <p>I plan to return here not later than early November to continue my work for Dr. Rhine and my own research and writing through the winter.</p> 
                
                <p>From 1963 until his death in 1969 my husband had serious health problems, and I did not have much time or heart for writing.</p> 
                
                <p>I write with happy memories and appreciation of you and of your work and with deep good wishes.</p> 
                <closer>    
                    <salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
