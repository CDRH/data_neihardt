                    <salute>Dear Dr. and Mrs. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>We hope you're doing alright this summer and aren't working too hard on the farm. I wondered if you did any lectures this summer as you did last year. Say hello to all the folks and give them a good word for us.</p>
                
                <p>We're in Baton Rouge, where I'm working as news director for a radio station. The work is varied and exciting, but also time-consuming. We went to Kansas City first, you recall, where I worked for seven months. We didn't like that too much, so we decided to try a job in radio news. So, here we are, but we find we don't like this too much, so we're planning another change. Terrible, isn't it, making so many changes?</p>
                
                <p>Well, we are thinking about coming back to school. I suppose we had thought of it quite a bit during our absence from <hi rend="caps">M.O.</hi>, but it didn't come right out until now. I think I'd like to get a degree in English and perhaps to go on <del>g</del><add>a</add>nd get a master's and doctor's degree in English. You recall we had talked about it before, and I believe you encouraged me. You also suggested, I think, that I might be able to do your biography. Well, of course, one of the

                    <fw type="curatorial">18</fw>
                
                    biggest questions I had to ask myself was: did I want to? Did I have the will to? I didn't want to jump into anything I might not have been able to do, so I never committed myself to you. Well, it would be such a big job&#8212; a very responsible undertaking, and something that would require a good portion of one's life.</p>
                
                <p>So, I have thought &#8212; and I feel like I would like to be your biographer if the job's still open. I realize, of course, that I am so inadequate, in many ways. I would have to have your very much desired help and encouragement...in order to do a good job. It goes without saying that I would have to devote a great deal of time to it. I think I'm ready to devote that time and effort, if you want me to.</p>
                
                <p>What I need is your approval and encouragement, if you think I can do it. Please let me know. If everything's alright, I will come back to school next February.</p>
                
                <p>Patti, my wife, and Leah Carter, the daughter, are doing fine. They're both healthy and have good sun-tans from the Louisiana sun.</p>
                
                <p>Until we hear a short note from you.</p>
