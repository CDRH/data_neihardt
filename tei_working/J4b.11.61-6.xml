Friday-AM-
Darling Enid mine: 
This is about 4.30 AM - I have done a lot of things in the way of putting the house in order - and am all dres-sed and have filled a thermos - jug with hot coffee and packed sandwhiches, pickles and apples in a backet - and now my thought turn to you my distant darling daughter - we are going to leave for Kansas City at 5.30 - Sigurd is driving us up - Maxine Aunt Lu Alice and I are 

62
all going to Grandma's funeral services in Kan-sas City at Newcomers' Funeral Home - Where we will meet Daddy who has telegraphed that Bur-nis Jenkins will give the Sermon, and that he, Dad-dy is staying at Jenkins' is home now. 
I suppose we will return home right after the Grematim has taken 

63
place - Although Sigurd is hoping we will stay sill the next day. I odn't think we cna do this as the houses will be here empty and the "pets" must be fed.-Any way i want you to know what we are doing - so you can be with us in <unclear/>. 
Darling - this will start a new era for us all - God give me the courage - God give me the love I need Oh God give me plenty of love to pass on to all 

64
concerned! 
Mother looks more beautiful in her white satin resting place - her lovely brow is more beautiful than ever - and the month is peaceful instead of dis-satisfied - She looks, as she doubtless is right now - her very best. 
She will come to me - that I know - and I have nothign to fear - Oh how I wish I might have saved her the hell of her last days - before she reconciled herself to the inevitable and expressed love for Lu 

65
for Alice and for me - who were close to her <del>at</del> in the last moments of her consciousness. She asked for you Enid dear shortly before she passed away, but understood that you were away - She said also-"Daddy should be at home - he should!" but she said she had nothing she wanted to tell him. 
Enid I'd not give that last night alone with Grandma for all the proper-ty in the world-Before she died she knew me - and Oh! you cannot understand what that means to me! 
Can you dear? 

66
Oh what we all need is Love more love! 
I must now get ready for our trip - 
Loads of love so you my sweet girl - and also to my one and only Mother-
from Mama.
