Dear Enat, Oddie &amp; Alice:
<p>I've just come up from under, and it's certainly been quite a while since I said hello. But I've thought a lot about you - all three.</p>
<p>I've been making steady and very satisfactory progress with <underline>Jed</underline>, and it seems strange that I may actually be through with my life job this year.</p>
<p>Yes, there might well be a chance for Gaki on the editorial page. I certainly had my chance more than once. Still, there could be more thrilling occupations, considering the disrepute in which all truth about anything vital is now held. Of course, one could write about things of a harmless nature.</p>
<p>We have a plan that may well work along with lecturing. Seems really feasible.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, <underline>Jed</underline> is coming on - which matter most.</p>
<p>You'll see the new ring before long, and the earrings will come somewhat later. I've had to wait for some supplies in order to finish. I'm planning to make a one-piece rock crystal vase</p>
61
<p>with raised flowers on it - the latter probably jewelled. My experience with crystall has been making me bolder.</p>
<p>Great weather here. The fishes all seem to be living, in our pool. I've looked after them. They feared only that Nanny &amp; Gaki had frozen to death and there wouldn't be any more oatmeal ever again.</p>
Endless love to all of you, singly and collectively,
Dad.
