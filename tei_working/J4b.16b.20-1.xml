Dearest Enid and Ollie
<p>You two dear children have been so dear to us, and we have been very happy to be in your sweet home so long. We were glad to get back to our own Home tho'. It looks sweeter every time I get back to it - it surprises me every time over again. Max has taken wonderful care of everything including the watering of the many flowers, all of which have grown to mammoth size <underline>almost</underline>! I have not seen such big zinnias for many years, and I'll Keep seed for you. They are at least 5 inches across. I'll save plants for you from those Petunias I mentioned to you. They are big double-carnations, not Petunias!</p>

<p><gap = "cutoff"/> a creamy colored Hollyhock, very double, is a grand surprise!</p>
<p>I just ate a big share of the cheese cake - it is <underline>so</underline> good! The Homing was a good surprise Enid dear; Many thanks again for everything!</p>
<p>The babies were so glad to see us - They are so sweet! Maxie had everything looking lovely and clean, <underline>every</underline> place and flowers all over the place, arranged so prettily - like my Enid!</p>
<p>She baked bread today, and got her packing done etc - and tomorrow she will leave for St Louis.</p>
<p>Loads of Love to you two, and
<underline>Please please</underline> come down <underline>any</underline>time you can!</p>
Your grateful and loving
Mama Mother
