My own Darling: 
We have been talk-ing about you and your work so much, Dr Statsney and I that I feel like I had gotten hold of things right side up once more. Isn't it aw ful to be going round and round and some out no where?! 
You dear dear wonderful Man - I do so want to be worthy of you that I do the very thing to make me less so, even, than I woudl naturally be - but if you just love me every

thing is fine! - 
Dr Statsney's cousin is Blanche Jurca the <unclear/> actress who plays the main role in A Tale of Two Cities (Meme Le Targe) you will remember? Now John I think she is just the woman to do your Russian Peasant Mother in 8 Hundred Ru-bels, and I read that Poem to Dr Statsney yesterday so that she too is very

anxious to have Blanche know it. She says Blanche is doing Radio work now and is just at a turn - ing point in her career. She loves poetry of course. Now won't you please write her something complimentary about her acting in A Tale of Two Cities and saying maybe that you believe she could do your Mother? Send this 

61
with a copy of Collected Poems to Dr Statsney or may I give her a copy from here! and Dr. S will write Blanche and send these to her. John, how wonderful if she'd read Eight Hun dred Rubels over the Radio on the national hook up?! I'm so eager for you to do this at once dear.. Send the note to Blanche 

62
with a letter to Dr Stats very right now, here. She is looking after me and may stal till Thursday - I hope so. She is having a real rest too. 
I'm better - Loads of Love, Darling
Mona.
