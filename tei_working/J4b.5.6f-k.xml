Dearest Ones:- 
I was with the Bookfellows last night out at the hoem of Farwell Edson, a musician. Certainly it wasn't a distinguished around, but we had a nice time. Edson is a lovable fellow & mrs. Edson is a new woman right - a politician with considerable power in the State of Calif. They are worth while, both of them. There was a rich chap there who is going to regenerate the world by means of love. he is over fifty - a good deal over - and I wonder where he has beau keeping himself. There was a <del/> woman of forty there - a nurse - who told me what a dance of a writer she <del/> is. She discovered it recently & has bad one story accepted, but can't remember the name of the <del/> lucky magazine! I asked her <del/> about her reading, & she alleged that she reads everything. I told her that it was ^a mistake to read everything and then the conversation switched.

They didn't get me back to the hotel until midnight. Tomorrow is my Ebell Club engagement, & I have <del/> just cancelled a dinner engagement for this evening, for I want to be right tomorrow. Edson will take me for a walk in the country at 11 this a.m., & that will do me good. I'll go to bed at six tonight & stay in bed until ten tomorrow. 
This Ebell Club, I hear, is rather hard to please. - not <del/> owing to any superior - culture but because it has the money to pay for celebrities. I am not afraid of them in the least, and I"m not on trial. They can like me or go to hell as they please. I'll give them only lyrics & the "800 Rubles". Lyrics always hold the animals. Also, I'll end just ten minutes short of an hour. Perhaps they'll bark for more, as almost always happens. They won't get much more. 
Very successful

This is not the best part of California. It's so fussy & pretentious & upstartish. The best place is within 100 miles of San Francisco - somewhere near the Santa Cruz maintains It wouldn't be bad to live up there at all, I ultimately me way land there. 
I certainly got a lot of five stuff from Brunninstable & the old Indian fighters. That was worth coming for - nothing else has been, as I see it. I'll be glad to get up north about Portland. Isn't it bully! I'm halfway home now - shall be over half way home now - shall be over half way by the time this reaches you. 
I guess the suit will not reach me in time to be used - not unless it should happen to be in town now. I'll call up tomorrow I see if it has arrived. I can get on nicely without it, however; tho' I'd

like a change for the Ebell Club; and I'd look a bit better in blue. 
5 P.m.
Just got back from a long walk in Elysian Park with Edson. It did me a world of good & the view was wonderful. The Lay down in the sun & talked. Edson said: "I've loved you since the Bundle of Myrrh appoared; but of course I couldn't marry you, but I've wanted to know you over since!" He's a full-blown, hearty miss, Has psychic experiences I talk of them as a matter of fact. he's moment - just sensitive to what so many never suspect all their lives- He's a musician - composer - & will send some things to Mona - one a piece for violin & <del/> piano for Mary & Mona to work up. It's called "a Bit of China" & is wirtten in the Chinese bay. He says it is

not difficult - only peculiar because of the <unclear/>. I haven't heard it, but I heard one of his that got into me pretty deep. 
Did I tell you that he & I went to a clairvoyant? Well, we did - just to see if a third medium would tell me shortly Brother story. The clairvoyant (?). Wet us at the door, disappeared & sent a chap in to say he was sick & couldn't "get our vibratous today"! Funny! she scared him, I think. Maybe the combination was too strong for him! We had telephoned & made an appointment with him too! I do hope I'll make good with the Ebell Club - but I'll be away soon anyway, & nothing comits but the work. 
I love you all so much! Kindest thoughts to Mary. 
Jno, Daddy

P.S. If the suit has not been sent to Los Angeles or Pasadena, you would of course hold it. Maybe it hasn't reached Branson yet. But if it does get to Branson in time it would be a good idea to send it to me care of Long at Omaha where I'll be about Jan 28th. I could doubtless use it there. I'd give a good deal to have it here, maybe, it will reach me tomorrow morning (Jan 14) at the last minute. 
You must remember that I can't write on long thinks & that that is why there was so long a time between letters from Waco & Los Angeles. The same will occur between Los A. and Portland. <del/> 
Don't worry.
Jno.
