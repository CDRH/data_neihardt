Dear Hiddy: 
Your letter received, and I hope you are the same. I take my pen in hard to say that you will know which letter this is by the fact that it talks about the library job. If it doesn't talk about that, then you will know it is some other letter & not this one. 
If the job will go a reasonable distance toward paying your expenses - you to be the judge of this - accept it, providing you really want to do so. If, by tkaing the job now you could be reasonably assured of having it next year also, then I would decide for it quickly. 
This is all I can say with the facts I have, and you will be quite able to decide for yourself wtih the above in mind. You need not hesitate to above in mind. You need not hesitate to refuse if you see it that way. 
Endless love 
Daddy 
The Black Hills possibility is to be remembered, of course
mama is for this too.
