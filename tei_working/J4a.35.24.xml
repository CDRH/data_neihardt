Dear John:
<p>I can't tell you adequately how much pleased I was to receive a copy of <underline>The Wonder of It All</underline>. I have admired you and your work for a long time, and I am delighted to have your poetry where I am able to enjoy it again and again in your own reading.</p>
<p>I am also most grateful for your interest in Ted. He looks upon his work in Epic America as a high point in his college career -- but of course many of our students have felt the same way about it.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your most thoughtful gift. I hope that I will get to see when you are next in Columbia. In the mean time best wishes to you.</p>
Cordially
