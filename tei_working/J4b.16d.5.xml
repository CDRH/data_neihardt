Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>your good letters are wonderful to receive - We can hardly wait for Tuesday, when we will start up to you. We will bring comforters Enid dear, so <sic>dont</sic> worry about having enough to keep our cold bones "comfy"!</p>
<p>It has been extremely cold here and our flowers, at last, are frozen hard.</p>
<p>We tried to Keep them for whoever might come down - but now they are gone.</p>
<p>It will be so good to see you all.</p>
Love as always and Auf Wiederschen,
Mother - Mama.
