Tuesday Morning
Precious Mona:
<p>You must be wondering why you haven't rec'd more letters. It's hard to explain to one who isn't along with us; but it's because of ruch <strike/> or weariness or both - often unconvenience too. I've thought about you <underline>plenty</underline>, just the same.</p>
<p>We've had a very successful time. I wrote about the U. of W. Virginia. It was the same or better at Berea. At the dinner here last ngiht (Auditorium Hotel) everything was lovely. I wish you could have been there. But you'll be at better affairs with me.</p>
<p>This morning Sig is trying to see that Radio man. We'll probably get started for St. Louis by noon.</p>

<p>I know the tight place we're in - it's plenty tight. Of course we'll get through all right. Sig is willing ot do what can &amp; must be done. we have something like $100 with us. Sig sent you $57 - want it?</p>
<p>How happy we can be with a reasonable amount of money! We're so fortunate I'm every way!</p>
<p>I'm a bit weary this morning too - have been for days, &amp; so have Sig and Max.</p>
<p>I'm eager to get home.</p>
