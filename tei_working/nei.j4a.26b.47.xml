                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I wanted to write you as soon as I returned home to thank you again for being on our program Saturday, but I was very tired and there was a great deal of Guild business to attend to. The business is attended to and I am somewhat rested, so now I take the first opportunity to write to you and to send you a copy of <hi rend="caps">PINNACLE JAKE</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>Meeting you and hearing you read "The Death of Sitting Bull" was one of the highlights in my whole life. The day in Omaha will be forever memorable to me because of you. A friend of mine brought her twenty-year-old daughter to the meeting. "How thankful I am that Mary heard Dr. Neihardt read his poetry," she said. "There will come a day when she will be one of the few people who can remember such an experience, and she will cherish the memory all her life." I believe she spoke for us all.</p>
                
                <p>I hope you like my father's story. He left us in January, 1956, and we miss him so much. I still want to tell him things, and ask him questions about the life he knew so well, and it hurts as much as ever to know that I cannot. He, too, liked Indians and regretted the bad deal we gave them, and are still giving them. I am sending you one of the few copies that I have left, which he autographed himself. He would like to know that you have it.</p>
                
                <p>I hope to be in southern Missouri within the next year, maybe even before the end of this year, and I will surely come by and see you if you are at home. A quiet talk with you would be priceless to me.</p>
                
                <p>And now I must close. Thank you again for coming to Omaha to be at our meeting. I truly hope you gained much enjoyment for yourself from your stay there and that the trip was plesant in every way.</p>
                <closer>
