HOTEL FORT DES MOINES
DES MOINES, IOWA

Precious Mona:
<p>Just rec'd your about Fortunato. It sounds perfectly sane, and I'm sure he's wholly sincere. Also, it's most encouraging as to Alice's progress in dancing. It seems to me that a compromise ought to be made. Cut down everyting not absolutely essential except the two dancing lessons - the <unclear>calisthenic's</unclear> late hours at night, movies. Just enough school work to go through satisfactorily. The fact that Alice will have summer vacation is all to the good, and she can go moderate practicing during vacation.

<p>she will be careful in conserving her strength, I'm sure.</p>
<p>Things go well here. The first Forum speech didn't please me, but the audience, at the end, seemed affectionate. I reorganized my talk, and last night I had a happy time with my group.</p>
<p>I'm going to take on everything + go through. It will be a satisfaction. Was at Lincoln High yesterday morning. A luncheon today, Roosevelt High tomorrow a.m etc. I'm quite all right. Max writes that she feels bum, but I'm sure it's nothing much.</p>
<p>Saw a good medium this morning. Same thing as always. Jed completed when chrysanthemum bloom. April May. June trip <unclear/>, Lots of travel + talk - and money a-plenty etc.</p>
Endless love,
Jno.
