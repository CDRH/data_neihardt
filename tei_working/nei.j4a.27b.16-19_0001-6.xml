                    <salute>Dear John;-</salute></opener> <p>So very glad to hear from you and to learn of the pleasant summer you have spent with your daughter and her children. However I was disappointed that you were not in Oregon and planning to visit us. So glad you have the opportunity to go thr<del/><add>ou</add>gh Harry Truman's library &#8212; Im<sic>I'm</sic> sure will enjoy it.</p>
                
                <p>So the Alys are in Missouri no wonder I haven't heard from her. So nice of them to

                    go with you to visit <del>the</del> your childhood hom<unclear>e.</unclear></p>
                
                <p>John is still here and is so much happier than when he first came. Im<sic>I'm</sic> so glad for him. He was so very bitter and confused at first. Wish he had a hobby to pas<del>t</del><add>s</add> away the time &#8212; He reads a lot which helps.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, I too wish we were neighbors. I have thoughts &#8212; beautiful thoughts Id<sic>I'd</sic> like to write but I dont<sic>don't</sic> seem to have the knowledge to do it. No doubt it is a desire carried on from a former life and Im<sic>I'm</sic> supposed to develop and advance to a higher plane than I was on formally. Strange, outstanding

                    <unclear>dr</unclear>eams but I can't interpret them so I struggle and grope to little avail for what I think <del/><add>are</add> the finer and better things of life.</p>
                
                <p>Our weather has been extremely warm but should soon get cooler.</p>
                
                <p>Have been very busy working &#8212; I crocheted a dresser scarf which I think is pretty and now I'm making another afghan &#8212; same pattern as yours. Made a tattered doil<del>e</del>y &#8212; afraid I do there things when I should be working at house work but

                    I do love to do it. Im<sic>I'm</sic> so glad you enjoy your afghan</p>
                
                <p>As to a gift from you an electric fry pan would be something Id<sic>I'd</sic> like very much to have but I would like more to have any small piece of Jade jewelry if you have made it. How ever without either I should always have kind and beautiful memories of you and you have no idea how often I think of you.</p>
