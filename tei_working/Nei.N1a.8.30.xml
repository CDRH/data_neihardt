Dear Dr. Neihardt: 
I am greatly enjoying your Cycle of the West. I am surely proud to know the author of this great work as well as I do, and with time I will improve the acquaintance I hope. 
How is your present undertaking pro-gressing? I hope it is keeping you both healthy and happy. 
I have a little exchange with Tom, some of it through our mutual friend, Mr. William Edward Cox, who visited Missouri recently and made contact with Tom and Joe. 
The summer is a busy time for us. People are coming in now for the Meeting that will take place at the end of the month. 
Kind regards. 
Sincerely yours, ,
J.B.Rhine
