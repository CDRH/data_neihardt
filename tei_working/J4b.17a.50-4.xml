Darling Enid and Ollie:
<p>It was a very pleasant trip, Sigurd driving us so smoothly - and treating us to dinner on the way - When we arrived the place looked as it always does, so sweet and bright. Maxie is not at all well and needs a rest as her finger has been paining her considerably. We are waiting to make sure it really is what she believes it to be, namely</p>
52
<p>a bruise caused by prolonged hurt from using the scissors over several weeks' time - and then the scickle after which it really began to hurt. She believes it is less painful now. If it should turn out to be a felon we will of course have it properly taken care of - <sic>Out</sic> we really hope and think it is not. The children as well as Max wanted to hear all the details about your darling babye etc.</p>
<p>I think you would have bene thrilled</p>
53
<p>at the lovely picture we gave of our blessed grandson! He surely is a swell baby and we want to see him soon again.</p>
<p>I have sent the scales up to you - It <underline>is</underline> hard to read the face but you can weigh him and make a mark on the dial each time, which will show you that he is, or is not gaining, can't you?</p>
<p>You Ollie might even make new numbers on it. The scales are good</p>
54
<p>ones and you may Keep them.</p>
<p>We are so happy to have all those good peaches, you gave us <underline>too</underline> many!</p>
<p>Nanny is sending a wee brush for our Neihardt Boy - if you Ollie have gotten one it is O.K. to have two of them!</p>
<p>I love you three and want to hear from you soon.</p>
Lovingly 
Mama-Mother
Nanny
