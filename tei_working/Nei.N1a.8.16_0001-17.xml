Dear Dr. Neihardt, 
You possess a marvelous talent. To put into verse what you feel in your heart, is a rare ability. 
Many times I have felt the beauty of nature as you expressed in your verse written on a Sunday morning, and wished I could express my feelings. 
Again let me say "thank you" for performing so beautifically for our Phi Delta Gamma group. 
Please accept this check as a small token of our sincere

appreciation. Use it as you wish. 
Sincerely,
