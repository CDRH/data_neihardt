My dearest - 
I must say that I have never experienced a Xmas with so much happiness! 
Darlin' - that photograph is so sweet of you, and I treasure it so! It was the one thing I did want so much, and I'm so glad that you knew it. 
Our love is so true and beautiful my darlin', and it gives me the happiness & pep. that is so necessary in these times of depression! 
I feel that I can do antyhing in this life - & I will. Your love & dependability is the lucky "bracer" of my life, & honey you're so dear to me! Appreciate you so, & wouldn't tell you well, must go! this unless I meant it! 
Endless love, 
Sig.
