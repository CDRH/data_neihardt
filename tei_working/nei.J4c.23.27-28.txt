<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>I have a notion that I'll have a letter from you this morning. This could be wishful thinking. I hope not! Dr. Robinson is changing the date for my talk - the 26th, I believe. My ticket is changed for return from Portland the 
<hi rend="underline">morning</hi> of the 28th. He wants some publicity stuff. Can't you

give him enough for his purpose. I have no folder here, but I believe you have one. I've made some suggestions to him. I'm eager for the day! Bless you and yours!</p>

						<p>Affectionately,</p>
