<p>Dear Sterling:</p>

	<p>I'm planning to get away from Berkeley on Tuesday, March 5th. Thursday P. M. <sic>p. m.</sic>, the 7th, I'll take a Pacific S. S. Co. boat for Seattle. Can't we do something together in the intervening time? I hope so. Could we fly down to Monterey Tuesday evening late, stroll around there Wednesday, & get back to S. F fairly early Thursday morning?</p>
	<p>I want to see Monterey-one of my heroes goes there & mixes with the Spanish authorities - and God! but it would be great to go there with you.</p>


	</p>Yours,</p>
