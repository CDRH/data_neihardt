Dear Dad &amp; Mama:
<p>I have not written lately owing to our expecting your arrival here most any time.</p>
<p>I do hope you will be very cautious with your back. I wish I could be there for a few days &amp; help out until you are able to get around. Surely htis trouble will clear up soon. If not, please let me know, because I could get away from here a while if necessary.</p>
<p>the coming week I fully expect <underline>two</underline> organ deals. the continual plugging seesm to be accomplishing something. Strange thing, with you probably helping me, my right arm is in perfectly normal conidition. I'm <underline>so</underline> grateful.</p>
<p>Today, Maxie &amp; I shall go to WTMV Radio Station &amp; play the program for Dr. Starck's</p>
over
<p>4:30-5:00 (Sun.) Acquarian School series. I shall very likely be on each Sunday, at least <sic>'til</sic> my repertoire becomes exhausted.</p>
<p>This outfit is trying to pull strings' for an honorary degree for me (in piano playing). Ha! It would be given by the State. It's a cinch that I'd not object. I do hope we hear soon that you have improved. Are you having a Chiropractor or someone who can help?</p>
Endless love,
Sig.
