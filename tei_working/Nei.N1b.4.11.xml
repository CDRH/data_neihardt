Dear Sister Grace Irene: 
It was very good of you to send me the clipping from the Hartington Herald which describes the death of my old friend Chet, your father. I am veryw glad to know the details of the affair. 
The Youngs and I greatly enjoyed our brief visit with you in October, and I hope the visit may be repated before too long. 
Please give my kindest thoughts to your Mother Superior, who delighted and surprised me with her knowledge of my work, and be sure that you have the best wishes from all of us here. 
Your friend, 
John G. Neihardt
