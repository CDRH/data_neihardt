Dear John:
<p>Just before I left on a trip I received the record and I must tell you have grateful I am to get it. I did not get a chance to play it until I got back but it is delightful to have your words in your own voice. I think the reproduction is excellent. It recalls to minds the days we used to hear you on TV.</p>
<p>I hope you are having a good winter.</p>
Cordially,
<signed>Elmer</signed>
