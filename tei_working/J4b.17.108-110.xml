Dearest Children:
<p>Enid darling you were a dear to type our poem for us, and so quickly - and it was quite "Plan massing" that you and not any one else should have donw so - So god "Mother" is now with you, and tell her I am so sorry we did not meet again.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to have the children here and Hilda had much to tell of yoru sweetness to her Sunday before - also Alice wrote about it.</p>
<p>I do hope you now have our wedding ring on your dear hand - Keep it there till we come in May.</p>
<p>I'm glad you enjoyed Sigurd's broad cast. He should be earning a living that way.</p>
<p>Our Wisteria is a sight cluster upon cluster of heaven by blooms! The lilacs too</p>

<p>Are in full bloom. the little cherry tree is completely full of tiny cherries! The big purple Iris is beginning to bloom now. Am sending the Gardener's encyclopedia for you to enjoy Ollie - I think it is most fun to read! <underline>You</underline> ought to be writing a series of letters about your home doings to some old girl-friend, that could be published in the "Ladies' Home Journal" or "Better Homes and Garden", bringing in each month what you are doing in the Garden as well. You <underline>could</underline> if you <underline>would</underline> get down to it. You'd have everyoen laughing the way we here do when we read your letters!</p>
<p>Enid, here's your baby boy, not?</p>
Love in endlessness
Mama-Mother.
