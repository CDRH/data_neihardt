Dear Dr. Kendrick:

	Many, many thanks for the Book! And what a book it is! I'm reading with real pleasure and profit, for I know you are master of the subject. I admire the way in which you have organized your knowledge, and the clarity with which you present it. 
	Some months ago you sent me a beautiful little essay of yours, and I didn't say a word to you about it. I'm ashamed, but I'm thanking you now. There's a poet

-2-

in you certainly, but that did not surprise me after my visit with you and your brother.
	I'm sending you my latest - about the Sioux; and I'm getting the better of the trade!
	Thanks again - and kindest thoughts!

                        Sincerely,
