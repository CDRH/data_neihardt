Dear John,
<p>Here's the <underline>Tree</underline> chapter and I am so sorry not to have gotten this off earlier. I have been in a terrible bind, as you guessed. The doctor thought Daddy would be better off at home, and we had an unexpected hang-up on the arrangements for people to help me, so I had to do it all myself. It was a pleasure to take care of Daddy, but it took all my time and more than all my energy; we finally got set up with nurses and aids, and then he had a bad collapse and we took him to the hospital two days ago, ambulance and all--but they didn't this time blow the siren, thank goodness. So now I'm at work again; Bower and Stewart xxx are spelling me at the hospital, and I am going to finsih within the next three weeks. I am revising the second chapter which I will send you as soon as possible--it's the lyrics and <underline>River and I</underline> and <underline>Dawn-Builder</underline>, which, by the way, is a really good book. I'm so glad I didn't finish this biography five years ago when this chapter was written--I didn't see then what I see now! You will like this version. I have completely scrapped the section on the lyrics and rewritten it; also I have shifted the chapter around to get the analysis at the end so that it focuses emphasis on the lyrics themselves. This is the pattern in the other chapters, so I decided to treat the lyrics as one group.</p>
<p>I am so sorry I couldn't get to Nebraska for the Neihardt Day. I felt real grief about that--but I'll come to see you yet, some way. I appreciated Mrs. Vogt's letter; she has worked hard for this event, and it means a great deal to her. Can someone take a picture of you with the gold wreath for me? Just to be sure I have them all, before I wind up the last chapter, make me a list of the honors of the last eight years, will you? I don't want to leave out any of the laurel sprigs.</p>
<p>This isn't much of a letter; I'll do better as soon as I get this chapter done. Also, I'll try to write to Mrs. Young tomorrow--I appreciate everything she does. I'm looking forward to reading your manuscript.</p>
Much love. I hope this doesn't sound too hurried - we're all a bit upset.
