                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Thank you so much for your good letter of the 25th. I do appreciate every one of the good things you said about my father's book. I wish you two could have known each other. I am happy, too, that you enjoyed your time with us in Omaha.</p>
                
                <p>I have a new book coming out in November. It, too, is the biography of an old Westerner, a man born in Texas in 1873, who went north with cattle while still in his 'teens. He lived a most eventful life in Montana and the Dakotas and was once very wealthy and influential in that territory. He came here and spent six weeks with me, telling his story. He was a remarkable old man, six feet, six inches tall, with a lively sense of humor. I say "was" because, though he is still living, his mind has failed fast in the last two or three years and he is no longer living in the present. It is well that he told me his story when he did - and sad that it comes out too late for him to enjoy it. He will probably not even recognize his own book. He named it <hi rend="caps">THE WEST THAT WAS</hi> - From Texas to Montant, and it will be published under that title by the Southwest Methodis<add>t</add> University Press of Dallas.</p>
                
                <p>Dr. Neihardt, I have your <hi rend="caps">WHEN THE TREE FLOWERED</hi> and treasure it highly. However it is the only one of your works that I do have, so anything else you might care to send me would be so much appreciated. Your good letter goes into the big boxful of other letters from men who knew and appreciated the period of which my father told me. Every one of them is a gem to me, for they were thanking me for writing down another portion of the life they had loved so well and which has already passed forever from the earth. And I am so thankful for the major part <hi rend="caps">YOU</hi> have played in capturing for posterity a most important section of our national history. Bless you, we would have been so much, much poore<del>d</del><add>r</add> without it.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Sincerely</salute>
