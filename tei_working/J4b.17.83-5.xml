Dear Enot and Oddie:
<p>We slid down here with no jars, and it hardly seems that we are gar away. Mama will tell you how the flowers and twigs are doing, and I'll tell you about the Doctor. He was almost pathetically glad to see us. He followed me all around the place &amp; leaped up to grab me, just like a puppy dog. He's thinner and looked a bit worried.</p>
<p>Last night I kept thinking how nice it would be if you were here and Ollie were coming home at 7 o'clock every evening. I'd be willing to drive quite a distance every evening if that could make it so. There's surely something sweet about this place, and it needs our dear ones in it.</p>
<p>You both were so good to us, and we love you.</p>

<p>'Laine is around bein' a Wub as hard as she can.</p>
<p>News hasn't happened yet. When it does, we'll get out an extra.</p>
<p>We are happy when we think of you two happy together. That's priceless.</p>
<p><sic>Enot Peanot</sic>, I wasn't serious about that five. If you don't have to use ti for drayage, you can apply it on the movies!!</p>
<p>Thanks for everything!</p>
Love always,
Dad
