Dear Gaki: 
Yes, we are thrilled at the news of such worthy namessakes! We hope the "boy and girl" Hackneys prove to be the very best in all the illustrious history of the breed! Thanks for the honor - we wonder if the ceremonies will permit the crashing of a bottle of Cola ("rot-gut") over their bows, and we hope there need be very little prodding of their sterns. 
Bless their equine hearts!
We are counting the days, and sincerely ^hope you can come on Wednesday, Jan. 10th. We'll assume your time of arrival will be about as last month's trip - just before 1:00pm. Let us know if there is any change.  
As ever yours
Julius D. Young 
P.S. a "6-pack" is already in basement cooler. And it is not "cola"! J.D.Y.
