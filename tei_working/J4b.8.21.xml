My Dear Mrs. Berg.-
When I last wrote you in Kirkwood Mo. I could not give you an address as I expected to be in Minneapolis and Grinnell. Iowa - but did say at any rate I should be in Branson in March - will March has come and gone and I have been patiently watching the mails but no word from you, my dear, I think I could write a whole week to you and still not say all the things I would like but shall curl myself until i hear if you really want me to so for the present I'll just say I am sending love to you and yours and tell Mrs. Grane this apply to her too
Most sincerely
Alice M. Neihardt 
Branson Mo.
