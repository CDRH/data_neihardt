<p>Dear Friends:</p>

	<p>Many thanks for the stationery! I'll use it wherever I think it may do some good to the Order.</p>
	<p>Also, many thanks for the pleasant words in the Step Ladder.</p>
	<p>I suppose you'll be getting away from Chicago soon! I'm leaving here on the 17th, to be in and about the Adirondacks until middle July.</p>
	<p>I like to think of you two, and of the time we spent with you.</p>

					<p>Your friend,</p>
