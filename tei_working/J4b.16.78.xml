<p>Hiddenite is directly on our way from here to Rockhill, and teh ruby county is on our way home. It woudl be a good joke if I could get some of either or both by some fluke! Hardly likely. Guess we'll go to Radgford this P.M. How is Laine getting along with her two ends? Pettings for both wubs; Love to Max, the pants-incinerator. I'm hoping to see the nymph finished when we get back.</p>
Endless love,
Jno.
