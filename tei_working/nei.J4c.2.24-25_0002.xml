"Hugh Glass" goes on steadily, satisfactorily - no let up in the necessary enthusiasm; a sort of coral-reef process, but all consciously <unclear>. I believe it's worth while. 2,100 lives with 900 to do. No padding either - no slovenly work. So it seems to me.

The war knocked my review work - no book advertising. It rather put me up a tree. But you can't lose if you know where you're going. It's made a trying <unclear> for me, however. Just the same I'm geting ahead on "Hugh".

Damnit, Sterling, what's wrong with us? Nothing seems to matter much except getting it on paper! If I were  single + had no mother (which condition may God deny me!) I'd be happy in a cave with some tobacco + plenty of pencils + paper. The women never quite understand that and shouldn't!

Good luck, Old man!

Yours, Jno. N.
