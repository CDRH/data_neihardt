<p>Dear Friend:</p>

	<p>Many thanks for your kindness. I should like very much to remain an extra day with you, and I may be able to do so.</p>
	<p>The title of my talk will be "My Experience with a Sioux Holy Man."</p>
	<p>If any class should want me, I'd be glad to meet with it.</p>

				<p>With affectionate thoughts,</p>
