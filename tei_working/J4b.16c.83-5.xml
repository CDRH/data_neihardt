Tues. A.M.
Dear Oddie &amp; Enat:
<p>Dr. George Katt has joined the company of saints and become a eunuch! The sacred ceremony was performed and the sacrificial knife wielded by the Rev. Mr. Miser._ You will remember that the Doctor refused to run for the Presidency, even on the platform of a 21-egg week, on the grounds that he was too tired to run. As he will now be less tired, it is probably that he may choose to run in 1944.</p>
<p>Damned plutocrats you are, and I'll bet you've gone Wedelling! Huh! Country home, and all that! Snobs! High noses! Mama is a Wilkie man, but I'm voting</p>

<p>for Geo. Washington and the Lincoln, until Dr. Katt feels able to run.</p>
<p>Those were lovely letters. It make us glow inside to think of you two happy together.</p>
Endless love
Dad
