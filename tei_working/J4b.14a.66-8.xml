Dear Enot and Ollie:
I enjoy your letters, and then don't reply either promptly or adequately. It's one of my quaint customs. But I do enjoy the letters. Ollie tells so many interesting things - the news instinct, no doubt. Here nothing happens, but a whole lot is; and isness is hard to tell about! 
I'm sending your silver ring, Enot; but don't take it any more seriously than I do. You liked the opal in matrix anyway. I've been making ivory mountings - one for Mama's beautiful card cameo. It's impressive Ivory goes well with colored stones, but since heyday of ancient Rome, people haven't worn ivory rings - why not? Silly, I say; for they are lovely. 
So I've schemed a mounting for your amethyst, Enot - so planned as to show the whole stone. I may insert a metal band in ring for added strength - as the ancients did; but it isn't necessary. I'm waiting for more ivory. Used up the old brush top! 
Ollie, I'm for the idea of investing in a place if it can be done, and I should think it

could be done. 
At last Herzbrim in Hollywood has decided to submit "Three Friends"! Funny! Something may eventuate Here's hoping! 
I've had a fine run with "Jed" and now I'm at a dead standstill, Can't make the slightest move forward at present. It's always been that way - and such times of obstruction are hard to stand. But I'm a good christian and have such a sweet nature that I bear up. Damn it, however. 
It's april here - that soft, round, sweet smell in the air and the grass thriving again. 
We had a marvelous time at Wayne. Two glorious days - a dear experience. I, alone, had a bully time at the U. of K. C. Sig was away & met me at Nebraska City. K.C. U. wants me back for classes several days-
Be seeing you Thanksgiving! 
Endless love to you, 
singly and together. 
Dad.
