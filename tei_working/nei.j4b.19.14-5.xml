<hi rend="underline">Next Day</hi>
Dear Sig:
<p>Your good long letter has just arrived, and it gives me real satisfaction to know that you have stand a <hi rend="underline">difficult</hi> test and come through, as, of course, you would. It is a godsend that you could get into instrucment work. They <hi rend="underline">could</hi> have brungled &amp; kept you in a heavier, cruder sort of work. You will be of great value in Aviation after the war, if, by chance, you <hi rend="underline">should</hi> be compelled to stay in the work. And all the while your fingers are being protected. I'm so glad. Pray for the good road and light on the way. It works.</p>

<p>Take your time about Latham, but do go to him by appointment when you feel up to it. You would increase the good feeling definitely, I know, and that helps always.</p>
<p>I've just rec'd the Institute year book, and I note that the Academy is a part of the Institute, bieng merely the last step up!</p>
<p>The Literature Committee (which admitted me) includes Wm Beebe, Sinclair Lewis, &amp; an Wych Brooks, Henry S. Cowby, Hendrih Van Loor, Mark Van Doren Boy! We should be doing stuff together.</p>
Love,
Dad.
