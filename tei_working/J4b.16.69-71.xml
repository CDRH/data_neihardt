Dear Enot adn Oddie:
<p>Only to say hello again. I've been having a wonderful run with Jed. I'd like to know what or who is making the stuff! Am beginning Part V, which will deal with the desert crossing - the high point from which the weight drops doomward. Also, the crystal ear rings &amp; crystal ring shape themselves very nicely. The former are bored for chain pendants and also for the setting of pink sapphires. Wow! <underline>You</underline> must have crystal ear rings set with amethyst, Enot Peanut. I'd like to know how in hell I'm to keep up with my jewerly making! So many womens, and more coming on, by God!</p>
<p>We're leaving for Virginia and the Carolinas Friday. We'll visit the ruby mines on the way. Maybe I can acquire a hunk to work on!</p>
<p>Don't trouble yourself, Enot. You are not only right, but you're all right in all ways.</p>
<p>So Oddie has been doing my portrait. Bully! I'm glad he cares for Gaki that much.</p>

<p>I, for my part, never knew a better man.</p>
Endless love
Dad
