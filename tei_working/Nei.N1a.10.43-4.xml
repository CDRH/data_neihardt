Dear Dr. Neiahrdt. 
The finest program I've ever seen and heard on TV was Dick Cavett's last night. You were and are superb. My husband, children and grandchildren all loved it: I hope Channel 7 will do a

repeat of it soon. 
I've always loved your poetry but I also love the way you give it, your wisdom, your humanity, your strength, your sense of humor and common sense, your closeness to nature and to God - all of this and more - you breathed into your short one hour (minus commericals) 
You have dwarfed

anyone who has ever been on TV including Mr. Fost. 
I hope you have done some recordings on records that we may buy. 
Thank you for a memorable evening. 
My ninety year old mother-in-law was thrilled, too. 
Sincerely, 
Doris Pinkerton Madhem
