                    <salute>My Dear Neihardt:</salute></opener> <p>May we not lay titles aside now that we know each other in person as well as in spirit? It was a great joy to hear of your work and its splendid progress. It will move by its own inherent logic and the consommation will come by virtue of this logic and will crown the theme. I have no fear of that. I wish I might put all my energy into my writing as you are doing, instead of waiting for the vacations when I am already tired out. But it is difficult to know what to do. My writing instead of being finan-
                
                    <pb facs="nei.j4a.10.7-10_0008"/>             
                
                    cially profitable, is a financial liability. I am some <unclear>"sooo</unclear> short on <hi rend="underline">A Realistic Universe</hi>, though I am glad I published it. With better publicity I might fare better, though I am afraid I should never be a popular writer. Literature has the advantage of philosophy in a larger audience, though those we do enkindle with the love of philosophy may count out of all proportion to their numbers.</p>
                
                <p>I have been wondering about the developments in Nebraska. They have been followed here with a great deal of interest and the local and college papers have reprinted items from the Nebraska papers. In some respects the Nebraska situation would

                    naturally appeal to you more than Carleton. There is so much of your life already in Nebraska. But I suppose there is a question whether either is consistent with your great life program. That you understand better than anyone else.</p>
                
                <p>I have had a call to the chair of philosophy at the University of South Dakota, Vermillion. It came through a former colleague of mine who is there now and is anxious to have me with him. Both the president and the dean of the college hae written me. Of course I am glad that they want me, but I am not clear that I ought to go. It is a question whether it would aid me in my productive work, though they are no doubt sincere in promising me <unclear>much</unclear> encouragement as they are able to give. They are very earnest. It is not the<unclear reason="missing"/>

                    they are young. I shall weigh the matter carefully before I decide. I don't suppose it would make much difference to the state of Minnesota, aside from my former students, if I should change states, though I have made Minnesota known the world over in the field of philosophy. There is no <add>recognized</add> laureatship in philosophy, and it is rather remote from the imagination of the public. In the nature of things it is universal, though the spirit of the West and its prairies has <add>perhaps</add> <del>no doubt</del> had its effect on my philosophy. I have sometimes been referred to as the philospher of the West, but I am not sure how far the West has anything to do with it.</p>
                
                <p>I should like to know whether there have been any fresh developments. And always your visit is welcome.</p>
