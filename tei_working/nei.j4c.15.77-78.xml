                Branson, Missouri

                <salute>Dear Comrade:</salute>
                </opener>
                
                <p>I am sorry my silence has made you worry about me. Nevertheless, I am sincerely glad that you care enough for me to worry about me.</p>
               
                <p>Nothing is the matter here. On the contrary, everything is going finely. As I told you in my last, I completed the Black Elk book on October 21, but I did not get the manuscript off until yesterday, although Enid had it all copied about as soon as I was through. We spent a lot of time looking for errors, not Enid's errors, but any that I <add>might</add><del/> have made.</p>
                
                <p>Let's not worry about Robinson. If there is any intelligence in time, it will take care of any narrowness of vision in anybody.</p>
               
                <p>I hope what I said about your travel notes did not seem unappreciative. I mean to say just what I said, that the thing was very pleasingly done and with a light humorous touch. But I am not satisfied<add>,</add> because I want to know what the experience really did to the deeper places in you. As for the Ode article, I did not want to be unfair. It strikes me as a fairly ingeni<add>o</add>us and interesting bit of critical diddling. Granting the significance of the thesis, the article is praiseworthy, but as I grow older I grow less and less tolerant of merely scholarly discussions of the outsides of things. I know you will get me exactly. I do most sincerely admire Vining's approach and manner. You should make Vining write more for you. The Magazine is greatly improved in appearance and its standard is easily maintained. You must be getting a good kick out of doing this. You should.</p>
                
                <p>Here is an amusing thing: I have just received an axious letter from H. S. Latham of the Macmillan Company, saying that while at the Chicago office a few days ago he heard that I had been granted a six months' leave of absence to complete
                    
                    
                    <note type="authorial">over</note>
                    
                    <pb facs="nei.j4c.15.77-78_0002"/>
                    <fw type="curatorial">78</fw>
                    
                    a new book, and he wondered if I would let Macmillans have it. He was always cordial, and, in the main, sincerely so, I'm sure; but this is especially cordial. I fancy Morrow is going to show him something that will make him wonder.</p>
