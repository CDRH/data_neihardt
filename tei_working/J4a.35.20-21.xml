Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Your letter was so welcome. I have just been listening to your latest record and everything comes through in wonderful tone and reality. I am so glad you made it. It is the one we order from Lincoln. In some ways I believe it better than the ones I got from South Dakota.</p>
<p>I am eager to listen in on the Dick Cavett interview. I wonder when it will be aired. I don't doubt that you are the most interesting person he has talked with. It comes as no surprise to me.</p>
<p>I received an invitation to speak to the Nebraska Association of English teachers on April 24 in Omaha. They wrote me that you are the main speaker. I am flattered to be on the same program that you are. It will be great to see you again.</p>
<p>Right now we are busy getting ready for the spring conference. The newsletter has to be completed and taken to the printer by March 1.</p>
<p>The doctor has been having his teeth pulled so hasn't been feeling too good. Soon this will be over and he should feel like himself again.</p>
<p>Alicia is a delight to all of us. She is at a band clinic in Orleans today.</p>
<p>Bill and his wife Jan continue to prosper. They call home every once in a while and bring us up to date.</p>
<p>I don't expect to be in Lincoln until sometime in April, and I'll see you in Omaha. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
<p>The very best form all of us to you.</p>
Affectionately,
Mildred
Mildred R. Bennett
