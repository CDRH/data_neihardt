Hilda Neihardt
Branson, 
Mo.-.
to Hilda Neihardt - with every good wish - 
Nothing is judged according to its size,-
Between the great, the small, Love sets no bar, 
And in the violets purple <unclear/> lies
All the immortal yonder a star.
Thomas <unclear/>: 6.

for Hilda Neihardt-
<figure/> 
Saint Christopher
CARRY me, hermit, to the further shore."
He hears; his huge limbs struggle, then grow slack
For fear to leap the torrent, swift and black, 
With crushing load grown heavier than before;
Yet high above the river's hollow roar,
Calm as a star against the tempest's rack, 
The Child cries, "Ferryman, upon thy back
Thou bearest Him Who all men's sorrow bore."
Then straight his rock-torn feet begin to sink
Into soft earth along the water's edge, 
And from the ragged cloud the moon rides free;
But no Child stand upon the reedy brink,-
Only a Voice breathes through the bending sedge, 
"Keep thou the ford and carry men to Me."
THOMAS S. JONES, JR.
