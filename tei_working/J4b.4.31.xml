[May 1, 1923] ? 
Dear Enid: - 
Your good letter reached me at Spencer, and I was so glad to get it. I read it just as soon as I got my hands on it, you can be sure. Grandma says you are all good children, and that doesn't surprise me, tho' I was glad to hear it. I'll be at home on the 13th or 14th, and I'll be the gladdest person! 
Lots of love,
Daddy
Tell Alice her Daddy loves her.
