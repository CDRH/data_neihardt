Dear Mrs. Berg
and Mrs. Graves:

	<p>"The Song of Jed Smith" was finished on April 16th, and so the <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi> is completed as planned 28 years ago. The new book will appear in the Fall, and the complete <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>, in one or two volumes, will probably be published next year.</p>
	<p>I've felt moved to share this bit of family news with two faithful ladies whose warm-hearted interest means a great deal to me.</p>

				<p>With kind thoughts,</p>
                         <signature>Jno. Neihardt</signature>	







                                    Mrs. John Berg
