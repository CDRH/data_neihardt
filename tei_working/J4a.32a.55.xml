Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>Thank you for your letter of the nineteenth; I have checked on the information which you requested.</p>
<p>Syracuse University has already requested copies of <underline>A Bundle of Myrrh</underline>, which we made and forwarded on October 28.</p>
<p>We have been unable to locate the county teacher's certificate which you referred to. Could you give us additional information about it? Could it be in the most recent addition to your collection?</p>
<p>Any suggestions which you may have which would facilitate our finding the teacher's certificate would be welcome.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Nancy C Prewitt</signed>
Nancy C. Prewitt
