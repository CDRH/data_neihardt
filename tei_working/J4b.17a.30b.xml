Dear Dad:
<p>I am so sorry to hear about Lloyd Mitchell. What was the final word from him?</p>
<p>The time is here now, for you &amp; me to figure what wre our mutual financial obligations &amp; govern all undertakings accordingly. I want to help, and that is understood.</p>
<p>In the long run, it would be best &amp; most economical for me to trade the Chrysler in on a trouble-free new car, in view of the situation explained in a letter today to Maxine. <underline>But</underline>, I <underline>will</underline> &amp; want to do what you &amp;
 I decide is best for now, &amp; in keeping with the situation we are in. Somehow, we must make my job help us all.</p>

<p>I fully expect a bonus on this months business. What a Godsend it would be. Last month I was 2<underline>nd</underline> highest salesman of hte organization. Not bad, considering the superior opportunities some of the others have. Is it?</p>
<p>Let me hear soon.</p>
<p>I'm going to try now to find a room &amp; board set-up where I can live mroe reasonably.</p>
Endless love,
Sig.
