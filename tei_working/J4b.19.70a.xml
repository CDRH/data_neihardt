Dear Daddy and Mama,
<p>I've just re-read the letter of the 15th to you, and I must admit, in a calmer mood, I almost blush to think of it. Perhaps I should not be sending such a thing to you at all - and I'm sure the censors have gotten quite a "kick" our of reading it. Perhaps I do sound a bit like a pulp magazine writer - but certainly such was not my intention. I am sending same anyway in hopes you'll bear with me. I might as well explain in writing for such is easier for me than speech, at times.</p>
<p>Our plans are changed a bit now. We are leaving Friday, as far as we shall play a week's engagement at a theatre plus club dates, maybe. Then we shall as per plan now, come back at once to Chicago, where George shall audition for and secure another girl, and I shall help teach her our dances. Sylvia will visit awhile in St. Louis. It will be grand to see all of you and to tell you all I have to tell of Mexico.</p>
<p>I got a grand letter from Sig and Max - and was thrilled for it. Also I've received a rather recent letter from my Hilda - and I shall answer it soon. Give my love to her, my Pal of pals and tell</p>

<p>her I'm thrilled over all she's doing it and that I have <hi rend="underline">much</hi> to say to her when I see her.</p>
<p>All my love to you dearest ones! Don't think I've gone "overboard" - I'm just a bit over-communicative at times and I want you to know I still have my head firmly on my shoulders as you've always believed me to have.</p>
<p>Till we meet soon again.</p>
Loads of Love,
your Alice
