                    <salute>Dear John:-</salute></opener> <p>It was so good as always to hear from you, my dear, dear friend: I should have replied sooner to your letter of June 5, but, despite the accuracy and legibility of the address, the letter was sent to Seneca Falls, and so only reached me a week ago. Still, even with this slip, I suppose the post office people do well. <del>They</del> What a wonderful <unclear>comment</unclear> you made on that little booklet by <unclear>Carlson</unclear>! I should have spotted his central error, as you did. But I thought I sensed the direction in which he was trying to move. That was what interested me.</p>
                    
                <p>I hope you carry out your idea of revising Poetic Values. That book is so <hi rend="underline">packed</hi> with contents, vital content. Many persons should read it. I have the feeling that they would be more willing to do so now than at the time of publication. So why not revise it. I do not think it would take you long.</p>
                
                <p>We have been to Illinois to see "our" family <unclear>there</unclear> The little granddaughter is fine, and we are very proud of the progress out son-in-laq is <unclear>making</unclear> <unclear/> art education. While there I

                    went to Columbia for a brief trip to see my brother. I had hoped to see you, but learned from your daughter that you had gone to see Alice in Mississippi. I do hope that she and those little girls are getting along fine. Do give them my very best wishes and warm regards. I have thought of them so often, and of the horses, too.</p>
                    
                <p>My, but we are busy these days, fixing up the house. We are having new bathroom fixtures put in on both sides, and some painting, and floor covering done. So the place is torn up and in a bad mess: But we trust that a real improvement is being wrought. The house had been neglected for a long time: So we knew when we bought it that many repairs were needed. <unclear>Gradually</unclear> we are making <unclear>them</unclear>. Nita is well, but having a much more practical and <unclear>managing</unclear> sort of mind than I have, you can imagine how <unclear>busy</unclear> she is.</p>
                
                <p>I hope toward the <del><unclear>latter</unclear></del> very last part of August to <del/> visit my brother again and to see you, too, for a good visit. I can never tell you how much you mean to me. And I read your poetry so much <unclear>that sentences</unclear> come unbidden to my mind.</p>
