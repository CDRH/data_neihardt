Dear Enat and Oddie:
<p>We reached home at 5:30, having taken our time. Everything fine here. THe house has been fone over and looks beautiful. Mama &amp; Max must have worked overtime while we were gone. Makes one feel snooty and a bit too good for the neighbors. George is well, and sends tender greets to Mitzi. We'll be invading you again almost too soon.</p>
<p>If you two weren't mine, I'd still think you were dear, lovely people. As it is, I just love you.</p>
Dad.
<p>Kind regards to the young ladies. It was a pleasure to meet them. They seem fairly intelligent and well-behaved. No doubt they have a nice mama and papa.</p>
