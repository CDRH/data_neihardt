Mrs. Alice Neihardt 
Branson, Missouri 
Dear Mrs. Neihardt:
Doctor House just called my attention to the fact that some organization in Omaha has a bust of Doctor Neihardt which was made by his wife and that this organization is soon to receive a portrait of him and when they do they will be willing to part with the bust. 
I thought it would be fine, if this program is carried out and we coudl get the bust for the State Normal School. I do not know of any place where it would be more appreciated than right here. 
Doctor House says you have the matter in charge and I am speaking now so that you may know that we will very greatly appreciate having the bust sent to us. Of course we will gladly pay all expenses connected with the change. 
Very truly,
<unclear/>
