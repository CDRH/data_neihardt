For dear little Hilda Neihardt I have inscribed this sonnet which I consider one of the best I have written.

Vespian's Circus 
Vast canopies across its crater float, Whose shadows splash the sauds with purple light; The swarming tiers, great slopes of curving white, <unclear/> roar as from a bellowing throat. Piercing the din, cries of the jungle float Mad scream of rage and howl of savage fright; A thousand beasts in the arena fight, While over all the grave the Augustus gloat. Under their jutting bastion tumult-tamed, 
The embers of the combat in his eye, Licking his bloody jaws, a wild dog shinks; And where the Caesar's from beans flare a maimed Mammoth in frenzy sweeps his trunk on high And hurls against the wall withing lynx.
