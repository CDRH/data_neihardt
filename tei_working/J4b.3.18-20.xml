My Dear little girl;
I am writing just a few lines that I should have written days ago to tell you we are all delighted at the prospect of your visit in July to end at the very ltest date possible. I did so much want you here next year but was afraid you might not like it and the wages are lower too than you have been having. We are planning some trips when you come, I want you and Monda to get out together, and come prepared for the water. Bring some big or rather heavy shoes for your comfort these rock are hard on shoes. And high heels are not in the game at all you would soon find out. Don't sew yourself to death we can sew here. We will be glad to rest part of the time.

John leaves for Omaha the 8th of June and the 16th the bust I had of John and which I presented ^to the Wayne college will be unveiled, and important ceremonies, Oh how I wish I could go I have cried some salty tears because I can't. 
I have had new potatoes out of my garden in May and buts and peas. Chickens will be ready to fry when you get here and all the Jersey milk you can drink, But then I'm not holding that as an incentive I come I want you to want to see us as badly as wewant ot see you. 
so now I'm going to say goodly and be glad when I can say Hello, best wishes to the good mother and father and love to your dear self
Most Sincerely
Alice M. Neihardt
