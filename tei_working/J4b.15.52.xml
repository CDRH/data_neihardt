Precious Mona:
<p>I'm through here, and it has been very successful. The last affiar at luncheon today in the Pomperian Room of younkers was a real swash.</p>
<p>Extraordinary crowd and 100% for me. Such a lot of fans!</p>
<p>I'm happy about the engagement, &amp; the Forum manager said: "You'll be back. This is a fond farewell, but not for long."</p>
<p>I just wanted to tell you.</p>
Endless love
Dad
