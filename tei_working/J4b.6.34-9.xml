My Dear Ones:-
This is the morning after but I have no dark brown taste - It was a wonderful day my day boy but because of you - the ceremonies were all that could be desired several people and among them^the governor-said to me it is the most sincere thing I ever witnessed and the monument is just right beautiful in its ruggedness as was expressed typical of the man" oh I never was so full of happiness I did not know that one person could contain so <del>much</del> happiness. Dr House was everywhere and a regular dynamo, oh how I wish I could be home with you this

<unclear/> there are so many things to tell you - the Judge came for me at the Hotel yesterday <unclear/> (Wednesday) in a pouring rain, we had breakfast and got into the waiting cab and were soon on our way to Wayne the clouds lifted and by the time we arrived the sun was shining as tho there never had been a cloud - Prof Lewis met us- The Judge was taken to Dr. House and I stopped at Crossland's to have dinner with Martha & Chas and Mrs. Greg and Effie Buffington, they had noticed from Lincoln the day before to be present at the unveiling, dinner over Charlie took us all over to the park where there had alread been parked, cars on two sides of the park and Every body in <unclear/> out I was besieged from Every side

I did not realize that I knew so many people, Mrs. Berg was there and I have promised to give her a day on my way home Miss Nell Porena and the <unclear/> girls were over from Bancroft - well the time came Dr has told you who took part and again I did the unveiling I think I will soon be authority on such things - really everything was so harm, <unclear/> and so many happy faces all around me - Dr said now when you have unveiled the monument then you may say what you want to - well what I had planned to say all left me but I am sure what I did say was much better; and when it was all over 
My bob is taken all right - lots of compliments for it

was just swamped with hand shakings and congratulations. I sat down beside the Judge and he patted me on the shoulder and said bully Dr. Said I had a notion to hug you - It was half past five when Mr. Lewis took Mrs. House and me I to the Boyd hotel to a Banquet for all the Speakers and myself included I was seated at the head of the table Pres. Conf at my left and the Governor at ^my right - I told him and the chancellor what your message was to them and I have tried to make Dr House and the judge feel how grateful we are, really John you can never never have a more loyal friend than Dr House and never again will I doubt him and I hope you will not ever. either, after the banquet the judge and I were taken to Dr House's
