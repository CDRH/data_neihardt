My own Darling
<p>We had a wonderful trip and the dear girls met us running but the first door and down the steps into the street. They are now getting our dinners, Sig's, their own, and mine - and Hilda has so much to tell me about things already. But the girls look better and are <underline>so</underline> happy to have me here. Needless to say we all are happy about the whole thing!</p>
<p>The coat fits Hilda perfectly - tell Max.</p>
<p>The Radio just told us that there is a bill up for decision this Spring, whether or not there should be a Negro University in Mo, preferably in St. Louis, because of big Negro population here - What about it?</p>
<p>The girls have seen an apartment they are crazy for - I'll see it tomorrow. Hilda thinks Betty will come to St Louis and try for a job - She is all fed up on teaching - has been accused of being pro-German among a lot of other rot. Hilda has already a good lead for</p>

<p>her with a friend of the Cousulate. Will write tomorrow when I have more to tell.</p>
<p>Kiss my babies and share all my "news" with Maxie.</p>
Love to the one and only Man in all the world for me
from his awnry old 
Girl
<p>P.S. Sig bought a nice basket for Enid to market with, and will go to her place after dinner.</p>
<p>Again all the love and more than all to my darling</p>
from Mona.
P.S.
<p>Sig says he's kind of homesick for you going out all by himself this trip.</p>
