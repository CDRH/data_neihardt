Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>It pleased me very much to receive your communicaitons of April 3rd and I have read the clippings with much interest. </p>
<p>I have received several letters from the University of Missouri Library, and one just today and shall also write in answer to Mr. Dickinson's letter that I shall be in attendance for the Friends of the Library meetings in Columbia April 20th. </p>
<p>I had not heard of the Thomas Jefferson Award on April 12th and should like to be present for this occasion which is taking place on the steps of Jesse Hall, but am not sure I will be able to make it on Good Friday.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you in the near future, I remain with kind regards and pleasant remembrances.</p>
Sincerely yours,
Gilbert Knipmeyer
<p>This matter was beautifully and most generously handled at the ceremony of April 20th, 68.</p>
