Dear Dad: 
Thanks for your latest, Sept. 25. It has been fine of you to send those two ^helpful checks recently! Yes, <del/> this summer has been the rough season of all for us and we are doing our best to get on the black side of the ledger. Things are slowly picking up despite an ulcer flare-up. Which forced me back to the "bland" diet plus ulcer-preventative medication. (I dare not say p---!) 
I recently had to spend three days in the intense heat, doing a major tune-up on Maxie's car. It turned out perfectly--actually finer than when a new car 32,000 miles ago. This saved about $57.00 -over garage cost &amp; I only used $12.00 in parts - I get all that parts stuff wholesale &amp; of course do not charge myself for labor (Ha!).

It is good to know that you are proceeding according to plan with the autobiography. I note the 1898 hobo trip is being written now. Hard to recall all the details of such an experience, I'll bet! 
Yours &amp; my experiences are to be included I note as also mentioned in a previous letter. Fine! Be sure to include some of the "naughty" things you would say to me backstage prior to my going on stage. Ha! It helped me to perform! 
Naturally, I'm deeply pleased to know that you are planning on using that sapphire in a ring for me! 
I wanted to reply as soon as possible. 
Do write soon. 
All our love, 
Sig.,  Maxie & Doxie.

Dear Dad: 
In discussing with you the lovely gem collection you've acquired through the years, you mention an exquisite ruby which I remember vividly, indeed! This ruby has been in your possession for a great many years and I do not claim ownership of it. Therefore, ^so far as I am concerned -- use it in any way your please. 
Endless love from your son Sigurd.
