Dear Sir and/or Madam:
<p>We are shipping your order of kitchen cultery day before tomorrow, and hope it will reach you the same day it arrives if not the afternoon before.</p>
<p>As you know, the paring knives in our famous Sts-Sold line are unsurpassed for quality. Altho we have been manufacturing these knives for only four or five years, already many of our customes repot having used them for a century or more with constant satisfaction. Surely this spells quality plus. Plus what, you ask? O that's just a professional expression of we business men! YOu will notice an oil stone, if you look sharp. If this is not properly used every coupld of days, the knife ain't <sic>gornteed</sic>.</p>

<underline>per Dad, Pres,</underline>
