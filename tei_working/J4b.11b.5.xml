Dearest children including Max we are sitting in the window of the Ozark Cafe waiting for "Hot Cakes" and coffee - It quit rain-ing at 8 o'clock and the Sun peep ed through the clouds at us! The car is running perfectly and we are all three as happy as can be - I'll never forget the sight of you 4 darlings like birdies in a nest calling out to us as we left. Mama is very rich and very fortunate and she loves you a lot
