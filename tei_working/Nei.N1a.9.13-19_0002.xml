Dear <unclear>Wasau</unclear> Humanities <unclear/> 
All Three of you: 
How can I thank you for your time and for your graciousness!! 
Maybe someday I will find a way to give the three of 

14
you an hour or so of my life in return!!
Mrs. Young, you did leave a long of surprises for me. I now have a whole display of Neihardt in my library and in May, will, as usual, 

15 
send my collection to the library here for their "poetry month." I-so graciously- thanks each one of
you - and also the lamb with a <unclear>countenance</unclear>, who made me know I was really welcome Here. 

16
In May [3rd, 2:00 p.m., Joslyn Museum Lecture Hall] my second poetry show is being presented. I would
be so honored, if the three of you might come. Will see that you receive a formal invitation
later. 
In the meantime, know 

17
that I parted from you - full of human warmth and inspiration and very proud to be his possessor of
three Neihardt kisses!!
[I am collecting them; I keep them in a hidden place - near the poetic heart]!! 

18
Incidentally - if you would like to have a driver in May, I will select some very special human to
pick up and to return you. 
Best warmly, 
Sissie Newton
