Most Beautiful Lady:
By now you must be running low on pies, so I am sending you a few pie-getters. Some time when your Mama is too busy to notice, you can sneak out and do a bit of serious shopping at the pie-factory. Jan should be able to buy 5 doz assorted pies with this. 
From you worshipful 
Grandpa.
