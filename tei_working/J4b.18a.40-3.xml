Darling Enid:
<p>This is our baby's birthday! I am so eager to see him - and please understand Enid why I have not been able to finish his suit - but I wil after I get up to your home - I cannot do so now.</p>
<p>Amama wants to be with you Tuesday. She will come out on the street car, and asks if you will please telephone her to the Statler <underline>if</underline> you <underline>do not</underline> want her on Tuesday. She says too for you please not prepare a meal as she will probably eat an early lunch</p>

<p>or a late breakfast and then spend the best part of the day with you, and get back to the Hotel before supper. What she wants is to see you in your home and not cause any extra work upon your part. So know my Amama as we all do, Enid, it would be best to let her do as she asks. She is in much better condition now, but I fear for her anyway as she gets so excited so easily and needs to be helped to keep quiet inside. This is all in a hurry -</p>
<p>Soon we will be with you - but for now.</p>
Love and grattitude go with this to you all three from
Mama Mother
