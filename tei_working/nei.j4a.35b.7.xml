                    <salute>Dear John:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Your letter of June 9 has been forwarded to me here in London, where I am engaged in some studies in the libraries in the British Museum, and Lucile has come with me. I am sorry that it has taken so long to reach me--by slow boat, evidently--and I am truly sorry that you are distressed, even though I can understand why you would be.</p> 
                
                <p>John, you must be patient with Lucile and the job she has to do. For my part, I agree with the publisher's forthright staement<sic>statement</sic> that her manuscript is magnificent, and I am not happy that she must condense the story of Neihardt by a third or a half, even though this may make the book publishable at a price that will bring in more purchasers, more readers. But since she has had to condense the book, I applaud her sterling integrity in the way that she has done it: not content to take the easy way that she has done it: not content to take the easy way of cutting out sections or chapters entire: rather she has undertaken the task of re<del>q</del><add>w</add>riting the en<del>r</del><add>t</add>ire book, finding a way to say what needs to be said in more economical yet felicitous terms. As you know, perhaps better than I, her task has not been spimple: it is a little like co<del>j</del><add>n</add>densing'The Song the Indian Wars' by a third.</p> 
                
                <p>I think we will have good news for you soon, and I think you will like the new book.</p>
                
                <p>I know what you mean about the Cavett show. I spent a bit of time, I can tell you in alerting your former students--and mine--not only to see it but also to write in to Cavett afterwards. You would be amazed and pleased to know how whole-hearted was the response. I had a letter just the other day from my friend, Dr. Hugh Seabury, at the University of Iowa, lamenting that he had got only part of the program on tape, and I was happy to be able to refer him to a place where he could get the part of the program that he had not got.</p> 
                
                <p>We expect to be back in Oregon in September, in time for the opening of classes. Meanwhile we will pay a visit to Young Stewart (remember him?) in Boston. He has a son now, who will be a year old in November. Stewart <add>i</add>s doing his tour of duty in the <hi rend="caps">U.S.</hi> Air Force s<add>t</add>ationed at Pease <hi rend="caps">AFB</hi>, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p> 
                
                <p>We will keep in touch with you and write again soon. Meanwhile, let us hear from you again, at the address above.</p>
