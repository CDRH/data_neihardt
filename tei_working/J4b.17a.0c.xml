Dear Hilda,
<p>It seems almost impossible that I was with you yesterday and now we're so far apart. We had a lovely trip and everyone here is also lovely. The country is gorgeous - <underline>so</underline> much like our Ozarks. It was loads of fun watching the country change as we made the 4 hr trip from Nashville to Mayland - the flatlands gradually changed to deep valleys and high hills with Oaks, cedars, some pines covering them. The "hill people" here aer just like those in the Ozarks too.</p>
<p>I have charge of half a double cabin (No. 3 in my cabin) containing 8 campers, 4 in each side thusly, with my co counselor, a swell girl, Bitzie Talley from Dallas, and I "bunking" in the middle clear as bud, eh? Still gotta cold dearie? love It, but I betcha we both get rid of them soon, we hope</p>

<p>We met the whole group at Nashville and rode here from Mayland in mule - wagons - 2 miles.</p>
<p>Dinner will be at 6:10, then drawings for Amazons and Valkyries, then bedtime for children and counselors meeting for us.</p>
<p>Mrs. Long won't be here for a week, so I have to start classes on my own accord. Wish me luck, Hil! It seems I must teach mostly modern.</p>
<p>Could you send me a "raincoat", Hil - your white one, maybe. I think I'll need one.</p>
<p>Met some lovely girls who are new counselors here too.</p>
<p>Hil, the candy came in very handy on the train (Tell Mrs. W. tom) Everyone loved it. I still have some left. By the way, counselors <underline>can</underline> keep eatables, only campers cannot. Mitzie's birthday is Aug 3<underline>rd</underline>! Isn't that queer?</p>
<p>I'll write more later. Take good care of yourself and keep happy, Hil, dear <strike>girl</strike> sister!</p>
Loads of love,
Alice
