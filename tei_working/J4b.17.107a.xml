Dear Dad &amp; Mama:
<p>the drive back to St. Louis was rather nice, &amp; free of any trouble, but I surely didn't feel very good about leaving. Seems a shame that we are not all together somehow.</p>
<p>It was great to see you folks again, &amp; I hope that finances will permit another trip down there before long.</p>
<p>I'm trying to contact Planks, &amp; promise to keep after them this week until we know for sure about that engagement. Will you please have Maxie write me the date of the noraml, Ill. appearance, so I'll be able to set a nearby one for St. Louis, in case it materializes.</p>
<p>Now that Jed is finished I hope the West will offer lots of engagements. Somehow I feel hopeful about it.</p>

<p>You'll have lots of <underline>pep to throw away</underline>, I'll bet, since the 28 yrs. of burden is lifted. Fine that Mom finished the bust at this particular time.</p>
<p>It is nice weather now, &amp; I rather expect to be going on trips into the territory soon.</p>
<p>Please write when you feel like it.</p>
Endless love,
Sig.
