                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>No doubt you will be surprised to hear from me. I was delighted to learn of your series of lectures on your Epic Poems. I didn't get to hear the first one, but I am going to try to get home in time to hear some of them at least.</p>
                
                <p>My particular reason for writing to you now, is to inquire into the possibility of having you to give a talk to our Episcopal Business Women's Guild of Kansas City. The meeting would be on the second Tuesday in November at a dinner meeting at Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral.</p>

                <p>Our guild, for many ye<unclear>ars</unclear> has helped an Indian Mission of our church at Wakpala, <hi rend="caps">S.D.</hi> We learned of the need through the Bishop who put us in touch with native priest of our church, Father Bearsheart. (Father Bearsheart passed away in Jan. 1956.)</p>
                
                <p>We learned from Father Bearsheart of the struggle the Indians were having and the needs of the children in the orphanage there at Wakpala. Our guild decided to devote our November meeting ever year, which was our birthday celebration, to doing something for the children in the orphanage. So every year we have contributed money and clothing and toys for the

                <p>When I was made chairman of the committee, I corresponded with Father Bearsheart, and found out that there was a very great need amo<del>mg</del><add>ng</add> the older members of the tribe, so we started sending used clothing suitable for their needs. For a number of years now, we have sent from one to nine <add>large</add> boxes during the year.</p>
                
                <p>Since Father Bearsheart's death, Father Fay is the priest in charge. He says that now they are getting more help from a number of places, but that there is still a great need.</p>
                
                <p>Wakpala is close to the Black Hills. I remember hearing you mention the Black Hills when telling

                    about your interview with Black Elk.</p>
                
                <p>Knowing your interest in Indians in general, and in the Sioux in particular, I wondered if it would be possible to get you to come on the second Tuesday in November to talk to our Guild about the Indians &#8212; either about your poems or about "Black Elk Speaks."</p>
                
                <p>If so, please let me know what your charge would  be, so we can see if we can afford it. I told the girls that I had no idea what you charged for an evening, but would write and find out, if I could.</p>
