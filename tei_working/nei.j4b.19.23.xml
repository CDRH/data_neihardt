Dear Sig &amp; Max:
<p>Those were very dear letters, and we are grateful for them. It is fine to know of your success in the job. I expected it, but it's good to hear.</p>
<p>I couldn't plan, to go East now, altho' I feel sure, at last, that I am getting much better. Maybe later on it will seem the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Wimberly is working hard for me in Lincoln. Something may come of it. There are two other possibilities. I could hardly handle a job as I am just now, but that will work out reasonably soon, I hope &amp; believe.</p>
<p>Would you care to try women's colleges, and, maybe, Harvard?</p>
<p>There's nothing to say, really just at present - except that we do love you and are heartened by your good letters.</p>
<p>Don't feel from this that I'm very blue. I'm just not altho' I could easily be.</p>
<p>With endless love for you &amp; the precious young ladies - bless them!</p>
