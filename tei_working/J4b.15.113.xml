Monday Evening,
June 12, 1939.
Dear Mom:
<p>This is only a short note, because we're both ready for our second night of sound sleep. <underline>873</underline> miles of travel since we left you in Branson. Such perfectly flat country here in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota &amp; S. Dakota. Rather interesting, but would not be for very long, I fear. We all prefer to be near the mountains!</p>
<p>At this pint we are 45 miles form Moorhead, Minnesota. It is Monday Evening, a chance to locate a piano. Late Tues. we'll go on in to Moorhead &amp; be ready for the Wed. A.M. (9:00) appearance.</p>
<p>By 10:30 WED. we should be enroute to Aberdeen, S.D. 177 miles for the all-day Thursday affair. Friday we start home, &amp; shall probably stop in Omaha for a short visit with D.N. Vinsonhaler. Please <underline>take care</underline>, &amp; <underline>don't</underline> work. This should be a rest for you!</p>
Loads of Love from me &amp; from Dad!
<underline>Sig.</underline>
