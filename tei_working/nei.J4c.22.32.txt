This holiest of all the nights,                             My grandma says its more than fun
I wonder what it means?                                     And hanging up your stocking.
It's surely more than candlelights                          It's knowing any needy one
On tinselled evergreens.                                    Might be the Savior knocking.
It's more than toys that make it dear                       It's helping those who feel the rod
And eating pleasant things,                                 Of grief and heavy labors.  
For if you listen right you'll hear                         I guess its being nice to God
A murmuring of wings.                                       By loving all your neighbors

                                                                by John Neihardt

Dear Stewart:

Here's a little present. I'm sure you will know how to use it. <hi rend="underline">And don't overlook the affection it carries from</hi>

<p>Dear Slade:</p>

	<p>I'm mailing you a recording of excerpts from <hi rend="underline">Three Friends</hi>. I've lost track of Sanford Gray, who was doing this work. Haven't the slightest notion what happened to him. This recording is of fine quality, but I regret that we did not indicate what was omitted. With a copy of <hi rend="underline">The Song of Three Friends</hi> in hand while listening, this fault can be remedied.</p>
	<p><hi rend="underline">You are very dear.</hi></p>
	<p>Affectionate thoughts for you and Nita</p>

	<p>I wish we three could have a shot of <hi rend="underline">O-be-Joyful</hi> together! I'll talk at Oregon University in Feb. (Centennial Celebration) <hi rend="underline">Will fly</hi></p>
