Alice Darling:
<p>Your letter to Bartmer has not yet been given to me, but Hilda will undoubtedly bring it when she comes out here tomorrow.</p>
<p>the Stoker-deal has fallen through - and so we are now planning to return to our Home with Amamma as soon as she can come to St. Louis. She has not yet given us the exact date We have nothing new that is good to tell you Darling girlie - Daddy has only two lectures in June, but they will help. <underline>If</underline> Amamma wants to remain in Branson with us we can live nad not get into debt, and Daddy's lectures will cover the mortgage payment that we have to meet in September. So that is that!</p>
<p>Madame Cassan sent me her bill for you - It is $168.66 - a lucky number for us as it makes 9?! I have</p>
49
<p>written her the truth about our present situation, and that <strike>I</strike> you have told me you would assume the debt to her for us. Too bad but what can I do about it? I'd be so happy if I Knew how I could earn that money!</p>
<p>I cannot help feeling that something very good is yet to come to Daddy in a financial way, and that might be very soon. If and when it does you Know we will not let you carry the burden of debt for your training - Any way we admire and love you our dear fine girlie - and we <underline>do pray</underline> for you always.</p>
Devotedly -
Mama
