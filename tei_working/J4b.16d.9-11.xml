Dear Oddie &amp; Enat:
<p>Back again, and almost used to being here! Nice, easy trip, and no one got tired; but the place seemed a bit lonely after being with <sic>you'ns</sic>. I did  12 lines today - nothing possible mondays.</p>
<p>George is getting burly. He is now determined to run in 1944. Says a lot about the paramount issue of world peace.</p>
<p>it was really a pleasure to be with you two again. I mean really, not just taffy.</p>
<p>Ollie, am I right in feeling that you'd like to have the motor and line shaft? If you</p>
11
<p>really want a little power shop in the basement, I'll have the stuff ready to bring on the next trip. Maybe in some second0hand store you can find a grinding head for two stones, with a V-belt pulley in the middle. The grinding head shaft ought to be 3/4" in diameter, tapered 5/8" wheel hole. I saw one in St. Louis somewhere, but didn't price it. Should be cheap or no buy.</p>
<p>I'm sending for a little diamond dust to re-charge my drills. Have several jobs I must do this winter.</p>
<p>Little to say, as you see. But we love you. George says when he's president he won't enforce his law in the case of old friends, meow!</p>
