Enid Darling: 
Many thanks for those sweet flowers; Daddy had a good time iwth you and Ollie <del>s</del> and I thank you for all you did for him. by the way, did he leave his Pajama top at your place? He got home iwth the pants only. 
The things came O.K. and we all 3 worked like every thing to have the place look <del>everything</del> lovely by the time Dad got here! The Kitchen cabinet you found for me is just exactly what I wanted many thanks for it. I am wondering why you did not keep an end-table as I told you to do, dear?

you were good to be on the spot with Hilda and Alice helping them, many many thanks. 
Enid I'd be so glad if you would write me one letter a week regu larly, the way you used to do when in New York. You cannot know now how much I miss you. Surely you have plenty of time! I doubt if you realize how busy I am - there are many things to be done and I love all of them - but they take time and the days just simplpy fly.

the result. Where this piece is finished Daddy will help me cast it in cannot and place it at the point where our drive divides. Behind it we are plant ing our climbing roses, which are in too steady a location just now. 
Please plan to come down soon! The room is ready with the twin beds and you and Ollie may use both or either one as you wish! 
Please let me share your every day life by writing me all that you do, what you cook, sew or think. Loads of Love from 
Mama.
