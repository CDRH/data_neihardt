                    <salute>Dear John,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Many thanks for the letters. I shall take good care of them, and I appreciate your sending them. They are a great tribute to you, and I shall certainly use them.</p>
                
                <p>I shall keep the other document carefully too, and please write me of anything else like it. This summer we must talk about the psychic experiences; I have been reading Myers and the books he helped with, Guerney, Myers, and Podmore, and also Jones and some of the Patience Worth studies. It is an area of study that should be better known in general than it is. I have hoped something like this would happen, and I believe more will happen.</p>
                
                <p>What you say about your own hurt seeming small in the sight of all that goes on in the world is true, and yet the great small hurt is what keeps us human and adds up to the total. You are a really brave person &#8212; a great man always is &#8212; and you are brave in the matters of the spirit. When I read that part

                    of your letter I thought of Jed Smith. Do you recall the one bleak moment he had that meant so much to Evans because it showed Jed's humanity that made the courage even nobler? That's a bad sentence, but these are some of my favorite lines, and you've said what I mean better than I can.</p>
                
                <p>Someday I hope there will be an edition of your letters published. You may have forgotten some of the things you have said in them, but they should be available for people to read. Eventually there will be whole shelves of books about you. Somebody should study your symbolism, and somebody your sources, and somebody your place in philosophical history. I'm only a pioneer in the writing. But if I'm privileged to be a link in the chain I want to be a good, strong <hi rend="underline">true</hi> one. It's an important job to do, and I'm already lost in it; I'm appreciating to some degree the deep sense of moving in the strong current you had when you wrote the songs. The job is much bigger than any of the people who will write about you.</p>
                
                <p>Something else I'd like to tell you. You don't always know the power and extent of

                    your influence, as I've said before. This year, for instance, your letters and your kind words of encouragement have been a boon to Bower and me. We have been greatly distressed this winter over a problem in the family about which we could do nothing except fret. Every time we heard from you it lifted our spirits, and we are grateful. I suspect a good many students in your classes have had the same experience; an hour or so in your class and they could lift their chins and tackle the world again. Anyway, Bower and I both appreciate the lift, even though you didn't know we needed it</p>
                
                <p>In only a month we will be starting for Missouri. Before then, I'll have two more chapters sent to you. One is finished except for rewriting in one section; the other is getting along.</p>

                    <p>Have you seen "Bridge in the River Kwai"? It's good &#8212; an interesting study of a good but "fragmentary" man. I took Stewart and five of his friends to it &#8212; a big day!</p>
