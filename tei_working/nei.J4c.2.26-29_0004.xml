I spend Fridays, Saturdays + Sundays on my "Song of Hugh Glass", + the thing forges ahead in a way that surprises me. Have been getting 50 lines per week on the average. There is no padding in it. Old man, I believe I'm getting something worth while. Hope to finish by May.

Wish I could see you + have a hell of a good paw-wow with you!

How about pick my <unclear>?

Did I send copy of "<unclear> of Satan?"
