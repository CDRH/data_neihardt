<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>Any time we <hi rend="underline">can</hi> go to Nebraska is the best time, if it is the only time! I hope there will be time enough to make the trip from Texas, via Columbia, to Wayne, Bancroft, and Portland, without too much hurry. Be sure that I realize how valuable the summer months are to Bower with a book on his hands. Tell me something about the book. I'm interested.</p>
	<p>Bancroft is celebrating its 75th anniversary on June 20th, and a leading feature of the celebration will be a pageant representing my life there! I've just heard, and they want some information from me. Somehow

this is saddening, altho'<sic>although</sic> I feel I should be happy about it. I'm trying to learn more about a certain Martin Rich of New York who wants to buy the TV and movie rights for <hi rend="underline">When the Tree Flowered</hi>. I'll do nothing until I know more. I wish I could hear your class reciting the <hi rend="underline">Wars</hi>! Maybe I shall, "someday". (The word sounds like a bell tolling a long way off.)</p>
	<p>Within 3 1/2 weeks I'll fly to Memphis and see my <unclear> and Alice again. Where I'll go after that I don't know yet. I <hi rend="underline">should</hi> go to the Los Angeles region. There must be twenty friends and relatives around there I had dreamed a bit of a trip down

the coast in a ship, for I have an unpleasant aufwiederschen feeling that I'd like to lose somewhere. (Byron was not notably wise, but he said, Happiness was born a twin," and surely anything for oneself is nothing with the rim off!)</p>
	<p>Yes, Mona (Fink) <hi rend="underline">is</hi> mowing the yard again this year. She's finishing the backyard, and soon it will be a nice place to sit in the afternoons, say along about 5 o'clock our time. Day-dream<sic>daydream</sic> yourself there and bring Bower and Stewart along! I'll be ready with some ghostly tea and cakes!!</p>
	<p>Last Saturday an old student of mine flew with a friend from western Nebraska to have a day with me. At the same time, my

-4- poetry class of <hi rend="underline">last year</hi> came out for a picnic in the backyard! We finished with a session in the Prayer Garden. Lately I've been thinking of German lyric poetry, and I've wished I had seized the opportunity to speak the language with Mona. But I was so obsessed with the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> that I let the German go. How wonderfully the Germans express themselves! <hi rend="underline">A line can mean so much</hi>.</p>
	<p>Alice will be laid up with a cast on her leg for at least six weeks more. Sigurd is in Los Angeles with Joan (who will have a baby in August, bless her!) Max will go out there in five or six weeks. Bless you and yours -</p><signature>John</signature>
