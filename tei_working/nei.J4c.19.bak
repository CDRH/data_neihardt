<p>Dear Friend:</p>

	I was away from home when your letter arrived, and because Mona expected me back any day, she held the letter. I do wish we could have met, for Mona and I do sincerely cherish your friendship. This puts the feeling inadequately.
	I'll be so glad if you like <hi rend="underline">Jed</hi>. Curiously enough, the general opinion seems to be that it's my top. I doubt that, but there is a simplicity I've not shown in the others.
	In <hi rend="underline">Jed</hi> the <hi rend="underline">Other</hi> is constantly breaking through the dense medium of this world. In <hi rend="underline">The Song of the Messiah</hi>, the dense medium fades out, and <hi rend="underline">nothing</hi> is left but the abiding reality. Some have actually seen this by themselves.
	Some fine things have been said of the whole Cycle - the best I've seen being in the Washington ( D. C. ) Post of Oct. 26th. I have not subscribed to a press-clipping bureau, as I need to do. Perhaps I should; but somehow I'm not very curious.
	There's more in me I'd be happy to do, if I'm allowed by circumstances to do more. And it's rich stuff. Perhaps I'll have the privilege; but this is a pitiable world, truly.
	Affectionate thoughts from Mona &amp; me to you and Mrs. Graves.
