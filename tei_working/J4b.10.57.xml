Dear Hiddy:
It has just occured to me to ask how much cash I shoudl send you <del/> next Friday, since this is your last full week. have you been paying your room in advance? Will you want to come home on Tuesday or on Wednesday? I think Alcie is counting on going up on the bus this coming Friday or Saturday 
Love always, 
Dad
