Branson, Aug. 22, '42
Dearest Albert &amp; Hiddy:
<p>The postscript regarding the draft re-classification naturally troubles us too, but we're hoping that the board may have blundered, which is not at all unlikely. You belong to us, Albert, just as our other children belong to us, and we love you and are proud of you in exactly the same way. I believe profoundly in you two and in your destiny together. You will come through everything together.</p>
<p>I often think of the Wedding Book, lovingly and exquisitely made, &amp; the thought gives me the feelign of greatness.</p>
<p>Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rolfo will arrive Sunday (tomorrow) for a 3-day visit. You know he has set his heart on doing a study of Gaki's life &amp; work. He is going</p>

<p>at it in a most thorough way, building a broad background in Western History and World Literature. He says he feels happier than he has ever felt, because of the task he has assumed. It will be very good for him, at the least calculation. He's a fine workman in wood, and the way his joints melt into one piece gives me confidence in what he can do. He swears he will make a jewel box for Mama - and I've seen his inlays! His wife is a clear-eyed, genuine person.</p>
<p>Well, we'll be seeing you. Don't "bust a suspender" trying to plan on a trip here. We'd be happy if you could do it, but you'll be realistic about it, won't you?</p>
<p>Anyway, bless you both!</p>
<p>If Sig, Max &amp; Wubs are back, love in bucketsfulls for them <underline>too</underline>.</p>
Dad.
