Three of my Mothers brothers and one of my Father's went "west" is Montana as youngsters. We often visited them - Once when drought came Uncle Joe <unclear/> Camp  outfit and Jamely <unclear>wicheding</unclear> Missouri <unclear/> draw the stark from Musselshell to near Corrdion boarder. Once he shipped near train load of horses to Missouri market. </p>
<p>Then my good Norwegean husband grew up just east of Devils Lake N.D. We yet go to the farm, and the brother in law <unclear/> us over teachings.</p>
<p>So I heard <unclear/> from Frat Beaton for once I taught in high school . <unclear/> much <unclear/> the <unclear/> a few years sgo we stayed in the old hotel - Not much changed.</p>
