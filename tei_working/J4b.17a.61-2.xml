Dearest Daddy and Mama!!
<p>So glad to receive your dear postal this morning, Mutti!</p>
<p>I enclose two copies of Mr. Burke's fine article. It is really a wonderful thing, and I am going to go to pay him a visit.</p>
<p>We practiced again this morning. I am feeling all rested today after a good ngiht's sleep. Sig was feeling rested, too.</p>
<p>I am so glad the <unclear>Oesch's</unclear> and their little boy were there with you. It would be so nice for them to get to know you and Daddy. No one could associate with you two without reaping great benefit. I know that our being there just a few hours with you always gives <underline>me</underline> a feeling of renewed strength and <unclear>clear</unclear>, truer vision. The great strength of spirit that you both have and your faith and Hope are of endless good to the rest of us. Albert, for instance, thinks you are two Miracles!</p>
<p>I just got some of the pictures we took at home with the little camera. All came out, and some are very good. I'll send them on to you soon.</p>

<p>I shall have to get down to business here at the office now.</p>
With unending love as ever do you all,
Hilda
<p>Alice is feeling fine. We have lots of fun together.</p>
<p>If you can believe it, our groceries last month cost <underline>$14.90</underline>, plus $3 for kitchen privileges! We have had <underline>loads</underline> of fresh fruits and vegetables, eggs, cheese, butter - wonderful food. We have had meat only once or twice - bacon all the time. I am quite amazed.</p>
