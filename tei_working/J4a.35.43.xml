Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>On May 3, our EP Chapter of P.E.O. of Wisner, Nebr.. is going to the P.E.O. Home at Beatric, Nebr. I will be giving a program for the aged residence there. It will be about your works Dr. Neihardt, and also I will show some slides of the restoration at Bancroft and also the prayer garden.</p>
<p>We were wondering if it would be possible for you, and ancompanion if you wish, to join us that day to visit with the residence there and recite some of your poetry.</p>
<p>We could pick you up at your residence shortly after 12 noon and drive to Beatrice. We will have a program and a short meeting, and lunch. I'm sure we could have you home by 5 p.m.</p>
<p>It would be a thrill for all of us Dr. Neihardt if you could find the time to join us. I will be awaiting your reply.</p>
Sincerely yours,
<signed>Mrs. Russell Schweers</signed>
