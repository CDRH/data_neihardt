Dear Dad;
I had hoped I would receive my raise in June - guess it won't come about until my anniversary which falls the end of July making the beginning of my twelfth year with St. Paul. 
At any rate - and in spite of this - I can't send you a better father's day gift there to start re paying you for your efforts in my behalf. I believe I can keep the schedule going at this rate until my raise comes through - then I will pay off in full. 
I sincerely apologize for the lapse of time in repaying the 

balance and hope it has not put you in an embarrassing position. 
The enclosed will at last start my repayment. 
Strange how the world works isn't it? My new Manager seems well pleased with my capabilities, I have managed to hire five girls with insurance experience (almost unheard of) to go to our home office for training. I really am proud of myself. Please be proud with me. I know its a small thing as you see things - but its my first chance to be something for all of my family to be proud of. All my love
Sig sends endless love. Max.
