Mr. John Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska

Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>We were thrilled to receive your letter and to find that you are well and going strong on the autobiography. Is there a tentative completion date?</p>
<p>The German translation of "Black Elk Speaks" also arrived in fine shape. We have been unpacking our books as time allows, and only recently reached our Neihardts. It is getting to be a rich and imposing collection.</p>
<p>You are correct in assuming that I shall want to build a duplicate collection here, and shall do so as quickly as the book catalogs help me to do so. May I be brash and ask you if you would consider parting with a copy of "Divine Enchantment" for the St. Lawerence Library, which is known as the Owen D. Young Library? It would make sense to have at least a complete book collection of Neihardt here as we have a very serious interest in Indians and their education, with particular affiliations with the St. Regis Indian tribe. Some of the fugitive items can be xeroxed, of course, and will be, but I want to get after the books while there are some left.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful place and we find ourselves very busy and leading an exciting life.</p>
<p>With every good wish.</p>
Your friend,
<signed>Frank</signed> 
Frank P. Piskor
President
