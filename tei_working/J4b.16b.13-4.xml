Dearest Sigurd and Maxie:
<p>It was a shock to hear that you would not be down home this time - however it is good to hear that you Sigie are having your bad teeth out - <underline>at last</underline>! It is an inheritance from my precious Daddy, small, nervous type of teeth, which cause trouble early in life. I am so grateful you are having them taken out and hope you will have a thorough job done this time. You will never regret it. Bought teeth are better far than natural ones!</p>
<p>As for the dear children not being able to come to Branson - I <underline>am grieved</underline>, because they as well as Nanny wanted them here - But it is easy to see that "Daddy's" need must come first, and maybe then you all can plan to come home some other time. It is very wet here - we are having almost continuous rains, but the country is even more beautiful than ever.</p>
<P>Maxie, please send me</P>

<p>basic pattern, i.e. a simple dress pattern that fits Joanie right - also the same for Elaine, so that I can go ahead on somethings I want to make over to fit them. <underline>Please</underline> do this <underline>very soon</underline> for me.</p>
<p>Let me hear how you are getting along with the home - Are you buying furniture or draperies or what? Are you redecorating? Have you moved down into what was Hilda's room? All this means so much to me to Know, so that I can visualize your doings.</p>
<p>I am proud of you, Sigurd, for hanging on to your <strike>his</strike> <underline>very</underline> good job, even though it <underline>is</underline> hard. Once you <strike/> feel<strike>s</strike> better, you <strike>her</strike> maybe will not find it too hard. Give my very special love to the three girls - They Know how much Nanny adn Gaki love them!</p>
Always devotedly loving you -
Mom.
