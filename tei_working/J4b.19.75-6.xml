Darling Alice:
<p>Your splendid letters will be kept in order, and constitute some wonderful and priceless reading some future day! Bless your dear heart. I am too grateful and happy for word too. You surely are being helped by the one and only true Helper, and the Wubs both are quite thrilled that their prayers have been heard and so nearly granted! - When your card came asking for money by wire, I was here in charge of things and the dear <unclear/>. So I called Hilda at once and she was as usual right on the job to help. Please write <hi rend="underline">in time</hi> if you again need money so that it can be sent by <hi rend="underline">money order</hi>. Wiring <unclear/> too terribly much.</p>
<p>I am eager now to hear what the Seymours do for you. Daddy should receive $7500 for judging a poetry contest at once as he has com=</p>

<p>pleted his part - when it does come, he will refund the last 5 and any further money Hilda sends you.</p>
<p>He is today going to a wholesale jewelers' who needs a helper in their workshop - and I hope it will mean some employment for Daddy. Funny as that seems, after producing the greatest Poetry on our continent, yet it would surely help us a lot right now to receive <hi rend="underline">cash</hi>.</p>
<p>Daddy has been garden-planting with Ollie - and working hard, but we are very happy, all of us together. I am doing the necessary things here in town remaining till Max gets back from her "job". I arrive here every AM at 7 o'clock.</p>
<p>Loads of love to the finest girl in all the world and to her two pals.</p>
from
Your devoted Mama.
