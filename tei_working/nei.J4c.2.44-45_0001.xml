Dear Old Man:-

It gave me a thrill to see your handwriting on a package yesterday, and the contents made me happy.

What could I say about the book that I have not already either written or said about your poetry? I know many of poems, tho several of the finest are new to me. "Tidal" is a musical wonder + crammed with the old mystery of poetry.

I'm devilish proud of you, Sterling - yes, and fond of you.

One of these times I may write about some of the newer poems in detail.
