Dear Mom &amp; Amama;
<p>Glad to hear things are going right with you. I hope Amama gets in a hurry. Please don't thinK about sending the bed for it looKs as tho we may be called to Corpus Cisti &amp; it would be easier to move if we have a little as possible to taKe along. Babies send love &amp; hugs to Nannie &amp; Amama. GaKi was in yesterday &amp; stayed all nite, its such a treat to have him.</p>
Love,
Max.
