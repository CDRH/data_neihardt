Dear Mrs. Prewitt:
We have received the xeroxed copies of the Post-Dispatch material, and I inclose herewith my check
for $15.30 in payment. 
It was very good of you indeed to let us work on Saturday, and I want you to know that we are
grateful. 
I think Mrs. Aly of the University of Oregon, who is my biographer, has written you asking for
certain letters tha tyou have there. I am hoping tha tyou can find one by a Professor Herman
Gimmestad of Midland Lutheran College, Fremont, Nebraska. It is concerned with my visit there three
or four years ago, and I would be glad to have Mrs. Aly read it as it seems to be typical. 
With thanks for your great kindness. 
Sincerely,
John G. Neihardt
