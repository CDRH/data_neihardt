Dear Mama:-
I had a nice crowd here last night. The lower floor of the old "Opera House" was full. More were expected; but about ten riches of <unclear/> fell yesterday, & that cut out a good many. I got $60 for my share - which is surely entirely satisfactory to me. Fremont gave me a good deal bigger crowd: but it is a much larger town, of course; and then, the weather was fine while I was there. 
I think I held the crowd about as well as anywhere. I got that usual dead relience mean the end that I've come to look for. People remembered especially on my voice & my manner of reading. I'm glad these seem to strike people, for it means much for the success of future readings. I seem to be a goodreader & my voice seems to impress people. These are the last things

I used to expect of myself. I did not begin by considering my voice unusual. or my reading especially good; but so many visit on this. That I'm beginning to believe I got a dandy letter from Mona again yesterday, & one each from the precious wubs: Hilda's letter astounded me. The dear little girl! Doctor and Mrs. house were much surprised too. It's really very remarkable. 
I'm glad you got your cistern fixed at last. It should have been done from the beginning. Don't blame Drumeller too much. You got a great deal for $2500 when he gave you that house, in white of a few eaches here & there. That's the way you must see it. 
I'll leave here tomorrow (Sunday) morning & stay. Sunday nigth with Mines
