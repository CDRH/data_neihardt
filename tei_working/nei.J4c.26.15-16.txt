<p>Dear Slade:</p>

	<p>You know I think of you very often, whether I write or not. You are dear to me. I'm glad H. B. has bought a modern home in town. It did not seem right for him to be out there alone, and I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> he did 
<hi rend="underline">not</hi> like it. Silence and solitude are necessary now and then, even at frequent intervals; but we <hi rend="underline">are</hi> gregarious beings.</p>

	<p>Many thanks for delivering my message to Thompson and to Wlcox Bless their wise and good hearts!</p>

My classes this semester are bully, as usual. I always fear, each semester, that my <hi rend="underline">Epic America</hi> class will fall off, at last. It never does, somehow, and I'm always surprised at the perfect attention they give me. They are sweethearts!</p>

	<p>In my Writing of Poetry class I have some really gifted students. I teach, of course, <hi rend="underline">by indirection/hi>. The purpose is to create a <hi rend="underline">group mood</hi>

in the class which will make it a pleasure to work on verse as a means of expressing poetic experience. Before the end of the semester my classes, thus far, have all become unified with a feeling of something like affection for each other. You know, I believe, that <hi rend="underline">I</hi> have come to <hi rend="underline">think of poetry</hi> as <hi rend="underline">a way</hi> of seeing the world of men &amp; things - a <hi rend="underline">way of being</hi>, rather than of <hi rend="underline">way of writing</hi>. Anyway, I love you. Be happy. And give my warm regards to your precious Nita.</p>
