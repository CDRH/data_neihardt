Dear Sir:
Visitng and getting re-acquainted with the Staff at Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska. I was given your address. Being the great-great-grand daughter of Chief Logan Fontenell I always stop in and "visit" the pictures of my ancestors. Also visiting the Fontenell Forest and Cementary where I linger and find myself in another world of my ancestors. I am a nurse, at Mercy Hospital, and still doing research on Indians, especially The Omaha tribe. The Omaha Staff gave me  the wonderful impression of you and your life among my people and it would quite me a great Honor to meet you or to have the pleasure of hearing from you. 
Sincerely,
Viola Tyndall
