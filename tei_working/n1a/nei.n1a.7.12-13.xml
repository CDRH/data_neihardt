Dear Mr. Neihardt,
Thank you so much for the nice letters and the copy of "Black Elk's Prayer" - we really appreciate it. I have showed it to many of our friends with great pride and they all agree that we should feel honored to have it and also to have your acquaintance. - I know you are such a busy man and the fact that you have acknowledged my letter makes it that much more treasured. - 
We have enjoyed the newspaper write ups about you. - Especially the one in the Omaha World Herald before Easter about the Easter poem you wrote many years ago from a dream you had. - 
You said you would send me a copy of your book as soon as you have a hard bound copy. We

would just love it and I will gladly return to you all postage costs. -
I imagine you are busy on your autobiography. That must be quite an undertaking. 
Our Nebraska weather is terrible windy, isn't it.- 
Thank you, most sincerely. - 
Yours truly,
Mrs. Dick Dion
