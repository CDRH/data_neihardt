Dear Dad: 
I received the gorgeous  ring today and want you to know how deeply I appreciate it as well as your thoughtfulness in wanting me to have such a treasure! 
The fit is almost perfect. 
There is a drag as it goes over the knuckle, but it is slightly on the loose side after it slips over the joint. It is so slight that I'll have a removable 

-2- 11
sizer liner installed to allow for the finger enlarging as ^it does when practising considerably. I do not wish to have the size changed because it's too easy to get it a bit too tight. 
I am so happy that you are receiving so many honors as time goes by. It is also a happy thought to hear of the autobiography publication date about xmas time or before. It's great to know about The Splendid Wayfaring & When The Tree Flowered coming out again in August

I must close for now. 
This is only a short note and I'll try to be more thorough in the next letter soon. 
All our love, 
Sig, Maxie and Doxie.
