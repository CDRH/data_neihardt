Dear Dr. Neihardt, 
Congratulations upon your brilliant performance last night on Dick Cavett's special show! You were
handsome and certainly at your very best! You seemed very poised and self-assured. And to think this
will be seen by the nation. 
Please thank Mrs. Young for reminding me, but I'd not forgotten the special day. 
Your family must be terribly proud of your performance as all of us were. 
By the way, who was your hairdresser? Your hair was so pretty! 
Sincerely,
Ethel Sweet
