Thank you for your kind reply to my letter of introduction. I note that it was written Sept. 21st - the day that I <unclear/> to purgery here in <unclear/>. Then in Sunday, Sept. 25th, I <unclear/> to have a mild heart attack! So, I am in the midst of a rather long - forced "rest". Fortunately all is going well so that since October 2nd I have been able to continue my recuperation at <unclear/>. This of course gave me an opportunity to again read your works mentioned above -
