Dear Mr. Neihardt,
Tonight you brought a lump to my throat. Your words were so simple-yet so great, and so beautiful. "Men are just men, we are all the same, we should respect each others wisdom, each others cultures." 
Indeed if all mankind lived by these words, the world would be a beautiful place in which to live. 
Thank you for being on the Dick Cavett Show - and you have reminded me to try to live better tomorrow than I did today. 
Sincerely,
Mrs. Connie Ward
