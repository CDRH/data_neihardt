Dear Dr. Neihardt: 
I would like to stop out and visit with you some evening next week or I could come during the day if this would fit your schedule better. We are pushing ahead with plans with Stuhr promotion but there has been a delay because Dr. Shaeffer resigned as director and we've had to shift gears on the member-ship promotion schedule. However we will proceed as previously planned with the change in dates. I'd like to discuss this with you and to talk with you a bout how we might hel pyou with the promotion of the Bancroft project. If Mrs. Young will contact me about a time when I can see you I would appreciate it. 
Sincerely, 
Carroll
