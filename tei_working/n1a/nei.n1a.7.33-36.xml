Dear Sir,
While we were both campaigning for Bobby Brown for Sherriff of Munroe County, Florida, the Florida Keys, that is, (which we won, by the way,) I met an old friend of yours, Lester C. Gibbs. A pupil and admirer I should say! When I started coming out with my favorite excerpts from Oscar Wilde's "Ballad Of The Reading Gaol.", he asked if I weren't part of Indian, (As I do look it ) & came back at me with a excerpts from your "A Cycle Of The West" & "Song Of The Indian Wars.", & I must say, if we hadn't been working I would love to have been able to hear the whole thing. 
Having been very hastily transferred by the Submarine Service to Newport News Virginia, I no longer had occasion to speak to your friend, but I would greatly appreciate it, if you could tell me where I could find your books in this decadent town!

So far, all two book stores have promised to look into it, but I have recerived no further word! 
I am only half <unclear>esqumeaux</unclear>, but I'll bet we could sure square this note away if they'de only give us back half? 
From what Mr. Gibbs said, you are a most unusual man. If you ever are unbusy enough, I would surely love to hear from you. I am 35 summers, raise Pit Bull Terriers (Strictly against the law,) & read! And I am entirely lost amongst these people. I worked one week & got fired because I was accused of making fun on the customers by using words they didn't understand. This is not conceit, sir, it is just that I have never met this type of people before; as I only completed the 2nd year of High School myself. 
Would thoroughly enjoy learning from you, if you ever have time.
