Bancroft, Nebraska 
Dear Dr. Neihardt: 
In a conversation with Dr. John Christlieb of Omaha, Nebraska, he told me that you were with the husband and assisted him the night his Indian wife, Bright Eyes, died. The account of the in-cident intrigued me. I wonder if you could send me a few of the facts and circumstances surround-ing the event. I have oftne hard of the maiden, Bright Eyes, but know little about her heritage or background. 
Mrs. Wearin and I hope to visit Bancroft on Neihardt Day, Aug. 2, bartring some unforseen problem. 
I have several of your books that I would be flattered to have you autograph. 
I am enclosing a stamp for your reply, and my thanks. 
Sincerely, 
Otha D. Wearin
