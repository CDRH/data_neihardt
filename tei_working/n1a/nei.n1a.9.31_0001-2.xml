Dear Dr. Neihardt,

I have thought of you often but not written or called there are many reasons. The apartment house is sometimes
noisy - and I am often tired. In fact, part of the time I wonder when I'll ever get over being
tired. I hve hopes so far! Writing notes today trying to let my spread out family know how I am and
that I still am!
 
It is dull around here - though noisy whenever I would like to work. I suppose I have been <unclear/> rised to good
conditions! I would like to hear about your work - and your health. 
affectionately,
<unclear/> Sealock
