BIRTHDAY 
GREETINGS 
2

Best Wishes to you 
on your birthday
and always! 
I decided that your birthday should be celebrated long and more fully - so if you have a free hour between three and four on Thursday or Friday have Mrs. Young call me. I would like to have both J.D. and Myrtle come with you - 
We will toast your birthday in sherry or a very fine German wine whichever you prefer - over


the wine is very delicate - called the Madonna - Liebfraumilch - It is the first bottle I've bought in two years - 

Thank Mr. Young for fixing up the scales - It looks as though I may have lost another five pounds since Dec. 1st - but Christmas was not too helpful in that respect. 
Best Wishes for ten more good years of writing - affectionately,
Bess E. Day
