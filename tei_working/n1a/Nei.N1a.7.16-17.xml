Dear Mr. Neihardt
Let me send you this color print, taken at the luncheon in Branson during the <unclear/>. Keep the negative, because we have a copy of this picture for our permanent album. 
We were so richly delighted at your reading from the special volume "The Quest" that I ordered copies from the publisher - really to suffer the keen disappointments I fiinding the supply was exhausted - not a single copy left in store-house or on shelves. Times such as "the drift of the <del/> clouds - the lift of the moon" were pure music as you read them: I find too, in a recent incursion into <unclear>Emerson</unclear> that the circle concept occurs also in his work, of course. 
Forced to secure some <unclear/>, I have searched the files of the book-stores and come up with the paper-back Lyric and Dramatic Poems. The beauty is still there! 
Will you consent to autograph this copy- and return it at your convenience. I enclose here a stamped container. - In the other shipment: Lyric and Dramatic poems

Mrs. McCanse was made richly happy at getting to visit with your talented daughter during the anniversary celebration at Columbia (our <unclear>second home</unclear>) recently-Please remember her to us! 
Gratefully yours,
Ralph A. McCanse
