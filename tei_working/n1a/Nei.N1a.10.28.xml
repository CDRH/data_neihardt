Dear Dr. Neihardt, 
What a thrill is was for me to see you again after so many years: Your appearance on the Dick Cavett show was a sincere pleasure. 
I attended the University of Missouri from 1954-1958. The absolute highlight of my entire college career was the semester (spring '58) I took your course, "Epoch America." I treasure your inscription in my copy of Cycle of the West. 
For many years I taught fifth grade. I never missed a year of reading some of your work to my students. 
God bless you.
Most sincerely,
NaOma Levy
