Dear Mr. Donnelly:
I am most grateful to you for your generous efforts in looking for certain documents related to the Order of the Indian Wars of the United States. I value highly the documents you sent. They will be filed in my Historical Manuscripts Collection at the University of Missouri. I already have some valuable letters from General Godfrey, Major Lemly, and various others. A long handwritten Godfrey letter turned up just a day before yesterday when a friend of mine and I were scouting in the Collection. This letter has a good deal to say about Reno and his conduct at the Little Big Horn. It also quotes some intimate comment by Benteen.
