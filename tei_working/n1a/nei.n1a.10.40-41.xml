Dear Dr. Neihardt. - 
What a great enjoyable evening April 27th was for me. 
My big regret is that my two grand daughters did not hear and see you give the very wonderful poem "Crazy Horse" in way it could be understood. 
I have your Lyric and dramatic poems, now. must get Black Elk speaks 
Thank you so much 
Sincerely
