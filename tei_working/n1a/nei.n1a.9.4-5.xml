Dear Dr Neihardt: 
We think of you often & wish you the best 89th year anyone ever had! 
God Bless you! 
Here's hoping you'll remember 
That this is wishing you 
The very nicest things there are--
And plenty of them, too! 
Here's hoping you'll remember
It's a wish that's most sincere, 
And just forget that it arrived 
A trifle late this year. 
Many Happy Returns 
Of the Day
