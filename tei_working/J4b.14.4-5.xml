Enid darling: 
It was sweet to be with you and Ollie - and I'll always treasure that memory - Daddy is very glad to have your typewriter to <del>y</del> use. 
Please sotp by at the Hudson Movers, and tell them that they are definitely engaged to do our mov-ing the last of August. Also please look at the <del>refrigerator refrigerator</del> refrigera tor and if it is O.K. tell them we wnat it too at $1.50. Then please ask if they will take the round dining room table off our hands, and at what price. We simply cannot possibly use it here. This letter is hard to write, as I do not yet know where I belong. Everyone is so sweet and helping me get settled. We are going to be very happy. Loads of love to my first Girlie and her Mar 
from Mom.
