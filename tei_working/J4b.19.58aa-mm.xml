Mexico City.
Dear Daddy and mama,
<p>It has been several days now since I wrote you, so naturally I have much to say. This is so like another world, this Mexico - and a very, very wonderful one too. In fact, the beauty and scope of interest hire are <hi>so</hi> great that one is actually <hi>dazed</hi> at first - it is too much to comprehend all at once. Oh! I do so want you to know this Land of Enchantment.</p>
<p>The weather, first of all, is as near ideal as one can imagine. It is neither hot nor cold at any time - but bracing deliciously cool and invigorating. Although the elevation causes quite a bit of difficulty in breathing when one exercises strenuously, still, it is in the main part very beneficial to one's entire circulatory system (I am told). If feeling is any indication of wellbeing, we are certainly healthy people.</p>
<p>Where did I leave you? (It must have been with news of our first day in Mexico D. 7, so I shall continue from there. As you know, we arrived here on Monday, and spent a most exciting day at Bellas Artes, and in visiting our new apt., as well as Sansborn's Restaurant where all types of people swanky Americans, distinguished looking. Germans, French, and Spanish, and what have you come</p>
(2)
<p>to dine. This is a very charming restaurant founded by a Texan Pharmacist who came with the intention of establishing only a drug store, and, finding that food was often the cause of various disorders of his patients, decided to start a restaurant too. Besides this, Sanborn's now includes a large silvery and curio shop, expensive but really fine. The interior of the cast itself is quite the most beautiful. I've yet seen. made all in Spanish style architecture (balconies, etc.) it has a skylight of colored glass (high - very high up) which sheds a glow over the entire, large floor. The waitresses are all dressed in one type Mexican costume, and the food itself is both Mexican and American. Even Madame Perdu approves of its coffee. You see, here in Mexico we have cafe con leche (with milk), much more frequently than con cremo, and the coffee itself is so highly concentrated that a ratio of 1 cafe to 3 leche is generally required! I personally like it as such. Me gusto mucho!</p>
<p>Tuesday morning, the 6th we arose at 10:00, ate breakfast in the restaurant adjoining our hotel lobby, wrote letters, and went out walking. We went to Sanborn's for lunch (or dinner), then hurried black to the hotel to pack. moved into our lovely new apartment around 4:00, and unpacked, raving a bit about the general aspect of our little mansion as we worked. We have never had anything as nice anywhere - and we have this for 70 pesos apiece per month with gas, electricity, and telephone. That is, roughly, $14 per month. Our food we</p>

<p>get extremely reasonably at the Native Market (Mercado de San Juan), which is only seven or eight blocks away, and we can buy nearer if we so choose. <hi>Everything</hi> is furnished linens, lovely dishes and all. George, Doris and I went shopping at this Mercado de San Juan, in order to stock our new abode with a few needed groceries. My! How strange, quaint, and intensely interesting was that place. Everything from "soup to nuts" was being sold in a long line of <unclear>canopeed</unclear> stands. "Es muy bueno, Senorita. Es dulce" Each time I stopped to examine a new kind of fruit, etc., something like this greeted my ears. The sellers were most <sic>accomodating</sic>, trying to sell us absolutely everything they had to offer - and if we had possess enough pesos to do so, I'm sure we would have brought everything. Fresh shrimp, oysters, etc., too, Daddy - and really fine. I bought a new kind of fruit, the money, which looks like a kind of longish melon with gray skin, and has an orange pulp <sic>ressembling</sic> in looks and taste a baked sweet potatoe - muy delicioso (tres delicieux Doris bought some mangoes which look like smooth yellow pears and have a delicious orange meat inside those smoothie skins Madame Perdu cooks, like a true French chef-ess, and we do the cleaning up both at the table and after!) We have our privacy, too, in our own rooms, or our living room and sallea manjer, so no</p>

<p>ones toes are trampled on. In truth <unclear/> are quite a family. Over Madame Perdu nous parlons toujours en francais, et nus avons vrainent appris beaucoup a cause de ca. Maintain c'est tres facile a comprendre toutce - qu'elle dit, et nous <unclear/> trouvons pas difficile a parlerl grand la conversation n'est pas trop extraordinaire Maintenaut, aussi, parce que nous sommes au Mexique, nous avons une honne apportunite a apprendre l'Espagnol, et vous pouvez etra bien sur que japprendrai <unclear/> possible de cette joke langue. Ella ressemble beaucoup al francais mais la promouciation n'est pas de tout la meme chose. Je sais bien que j'ai fait beaucoup de fauz pas dans cette lettre, mais je venz vous ecrire en francais parce que je pense beaucoup dans cette langua, et parce que je venx apprendre plus comane ca. Voulez - vous une repondre un pen en francais, Mama? Je serais tres contente a causer avec vous dans la langue que je pourais appris de vous depuis longtemps, chere Manean.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning we arose,</p>

<p>breakfasted in our apartment, and dressed suitably for going shopping. All of us left together then the three of us "senoritas" went shopping alone. This turned out to be more of a window - shopping expedition than an actual buying - spree, for we were so intrigued and, it must be admitted, perplexed over the difference in stores here, that we had more fun than accomplishment. We walked through a kind of arcade peppered with little stands selling everything in the way of clothing, refreshments, and novelties - and for such a price as the buyer was clever enough to dictate. We were enthralled by all we saw, and must have looked like the rankest of "turista" suckers. We bought little, but stopped long enough in our scampering about enough in our scampering about to enjoy "fresas con crema" (strawberries with a mildly sour thick cream and sugar) - "muy muy deliciosas." Upon leaving the stands, we visited one of the three large department stores, which are situated on the square near a beautiful and ancient cathedral in the heart of Mexico City "en el corazon de Mexico" (Pronounced with "ch" sound, as in German). By 2:00 we <unclear/> ready for lunch, so went to a</p>
(6)
<p>restaurant which we found near "Biedermaider's" (a cosmopolitan city, you can see). Thence w walked to San Juan, and took a bus seven blocks (siete quadras, to the Folies Bergere Theatro. Had a short rehearsal on stage, and found our rigor increased but wind a bit hard-hit. When we become acclimatized all this will change. After rehearsal, we returned home. Madame and I went to the market, and we had "un bon diner - d3es cotelettes de veau, des pommes de terres, des tomates, etcetera. Did this and that after dinner and, at last, retired at 1:00 or so.</p>
<p>Thursday we managed to awaken at 10:00, take showers dress, eat breakfast, etc. Oh! I've forgotten to tell you something about yesterday (I mean Wednesday!) When we returned from shopping (Madame Perdu and I), I was presented with a note which had been placed under our door. It was from, guess who? Max. He said he was having a very hard time to get in touch with me, but at last had managed. You see, I'd sent him a card saying we were to arrive several days earlier</p>
58dd
(7)
<p>than we actually did, and that we were to stay at the Regis Hotel. Then we were detained in N. Laredo a few days, and besides, decided to stay at Hotel Coliseo- cheaper, Mexican-owned, and <hi>very</hi> fine in all respects. As I've found out later from Max, he happened to see a friend who worked at the Post office and had seen a card I sent much later from Coliso's, to correct my former card. The friend remembered that the Hotel I mentioned on that card began with a "C," and, by means of elimination, Max had finally found that we'd been at Coliseo's. They in turn gave him our address at the apartment. So you can see, he took a great deal of trouble in finding me. To continue with my "narrative," on the note was Max's telephone number at the Hotel where he was staying, and also the message that he could call for me any time after 7 P.M. I telephoned him at once, and we had a nice conversation. The others suggested having him over "pourile cafe," so that was just what happened. At 8:15 Max arrived, looking fine, tanned, and handsome - and truly</p>
(8)
<p>"gentille". Madame Perdu was thrilled at his French, and we all were thrilled by his intensely interesting stories of Mexico and ranch life. It seems that the country where his and his brother's Rancho San to Takia (80 miles from here) is situated is yet very wild. It is 12,000 ft. in elevation, and is plainsy with surrounding mountains. The two of them have, starting from adobe, thatched-croofed, huts, established a fine house with all modern improvements (the only ones in that part of the country, Max added modestly - as he is inately), all types of other ranch structures, and, with the enlisted aid of quite a number of "peones", put many acres of land into cultivation. He has fine horses too. As for neighbors, however, those are a bit on the untamed unsocial side (not all of course) for they sometimes steal horses, or even commit outright murder to gain such or similar properly. Max says they must at all times carry a gun. "People say 'It must be marvelous to live such a peaceful life on your own rancho.' If they only <hi>knew</hi> that every minute of our lives there is filled with excitement! Our day begins at 7:00, when we detail our peones to their</p>
58ee
(9)
<p>various tasks for the day, and <unclear/> not end till, after riding or walking all day from one group to another seeing that work is being done right (if not actually doing it ourselves), for lack of knowledge on the part of our peones), we return for supper, after which we sink exhausted into our beds. Then, there is other excitement too - shooting, or making good damages done but <unclear/> of our escaped horses, or one of a million other possibilities." But that is not all he told. Above this I remember what he described of the millions of flowers that blossom there certain times of the year, the beauties of the surrounding snow-capped mountains, the miles of perfect horse-country. Villa Guerrea, near where Rancho Santo Tobiasi's located, is a nice little village, where even occasional dances and other social gatherings are held. Of course, Max and his brother, are looked up to by everyone there, and hold quite a position for several reasons. We were enthralled for several hours by these stories, which we encouraged Max to tell us, and later had Max to tell us, and later had coffee and sweet pastries (cafe y pan dulce) about 11:30, he left - leaving a fine</p>
(10)
<p>impression in the minds of all. Really, I <hi>know</hi> if you knew Max you would heartily agree, for he is truly fine. I say this from a purely unbiased, unpremeditated standpoint, for it is a true joy to find such a spirit as this in a world where such is not too terribly common.</p>
<p>To continue with Thursday, w spent that day in such a flurry of activity that I yet cannot really grasp all of what I saw and felt. It was a joy form beginning to end - of that I am certain. Max called for me at 1:30, and we boarded a bus bound for Capultepee Park "El Bosque de Cahpultepec:. Driving along several miles of an indescribably lovely Boulevard - El Paseo de la Reforma, we passed many lovely homes (You would jump up and down with glee at the styles in architecture, the unbelievably brilliant, boganvilla (a brilliant red-purple climbing flower) and flowering trees, theatres and Night Clubs. Then cam "the Angel," a huge gold angel set high above the highway, and guarding the entrance to Chapultepec. Other monuments too, and beyond these, visible from quite a distance, "the Castle" home of Maximiliano and Larlota. We got out of the bus at the entrance to the park, and</p>
58ff
(11)
<p>continued on foot along one of the beautiful footpaths, which leads beneath huge trees of every species, to the road climbing to the Castle. Passing the guards of the fate, we wound our way uphill on the little sidewalk to the foot of the long staircase. Continued up these till, we came at last to the castle where Maximiliano had actually lived. We went first of all to the railing to see the excellent view of all the city. That is a sight I cannot hope to describe - but I <hi>can</hi> say I was truly overcome and undeniably <hi>enchanted</hi> by what we saw. Max painted out everything to me and we chatted of many things. Later we got glimpses of the rooms of the castle - furnished so gorgeously, and so well preserved for posterity. Last of all we walked around the railing, taking in a last bit of the beauty of that view - the shining buildings of all types and sizes, the beautiful paseos, avenidas, calles, and beyond and above all this, the majesty and serenity of high mountains - no snow - capped ones, such as Popocatepetes and <unclear/> were visible, however, for it was too foggy. After descending the stairs, we went walking along a lovely path, then had "<unclear>repcesnas</unclear>" at a little outdoor restaurant, where we talked and generally enjoyed ourselves. With</p>
(12)
<p>a bit of effort we forced ourselves to return to our bus. While waiting for it, Max asked if I'd care to go to the opera "Barber for Seville" with him at 9:00 that evening. Of course I was delighted, and readily consented. We boarded our bus (1st class, for the 2nd class are usually overcrowded) and rode near the apt. Took a take there (one may ride quite a distance for one peso) bound for the Folies Bergere, where we were to rehearse at 4:30. I was early, but the others soon arrived and we quickly set about dressing. Max of course, left me at the door. We worked on new numbers during rehearsal (which Valencia watched), and did much more than on the previous day. By 6:30 we were home, and a dinner built around steak was soon neatly prepared - and eaten. Then we cleaned up the dishes as usual. Afterwards we dressed - they to go to a movie, I to go to the Opera with Max. A little before mine he came, and we drove in his nice car to the Palacio del Bellas Artes. The night was a glorious array of stars and velvet sky - immense and brilliant, as we hurried from our parked car into the marble-walled, splendid Palacio. We were not at all late, although it was nine o' clock already. Once the opera began, however, all went like clockwork. I had never seen</p>
58gg
(13)
<p>this opera - nor had Max, so we were particularly pleased by it as well as the actual performances of the artistas. It was a fine production all around and we enjoyed ourselves tremendously. Max does not pretend - he enjoys because he enjoys - not because it is "the thing to do" - so we got along beautifully. He understood all of the opera because he speaks Italian fluently, as well as English French, Swiss German, and, after two years in Mexico, Spanish. One would never know this until one discovered such, for he is too unassuming to blow his horn. In spite of this, there is a <hi>definite</hi> and unmistakeable <hi>drive</hi> in him - and a standard in all he says and does. Hence, he is <hi>stimulating</hi> to be with - and a gentleman to the finger typos. The "artistas" in the opera were most convincing in voice and acting - and were all entirely new names - even to Max. We sat in the balcony in <hi>perfect</hi> seats - and the whole thing was thrilling. Between acts, the huge curtain, made entirely of small pieces of painted glass arranged into a picture of Papo and Ixtace, was lowered, for examination by the audience. During outermission we walked up and down outside in the corridor talking of the opera. When it was over, we happily de-</p>
(14)
<p>scended and went out into the night air to our car. "Oh! you must cover your mouth like that" joked Max "The night air will harm you" as he pointed out a well-dressed couple who had planted their handkerchiefs firmly and concentrically before their mouths, as they hurried to the shelter of their closed auto. As we drove along the Paseo, Max said "Do you wish to go straight home or are you in favor of a detour?" I admitted I preferred the litter, so detour we did "There is a night club here which belongs to a Swiss band leader who was stranded in Mexico. I've never been there, but I hear it's <hi>very</hi> nice. Would you like to go there?" So we went to the "Casanova." It was truly charming - three rooms, each furnished differently, but all with adorable, large candles, which, later in the evening served from time to time as the only light. In the largest room was the dance floor, with one wall made of mirrors, and in a small one near it we found our little table. Max insisted on my "<hi>trying</hi> to eat something" with him, and besides, we drank ginger ale. You see, we are both terrible drunkards! Then we danced and</p>
58hh
(15)
<p>danced - and danced. Max is an excellent dancer - especially of rumbas, tangos, and waltzes, (jazz as well.) So we had one grand time together. "You must tell me when you want to go," he said. "When do <hi>you</hi> want to?" I asked. "I <hi>don't</hi> want to, for as far as I'm concerned, I'm having such a perfect time I am perfectly satisfied to stay here. But when you say, we'll go." As Max was going to take us to see the Pyramids the next day, we decided at last that we should leave a little before 3:00. Drove home, and I retired after a day almost too beautiful to be real.</p>
<p>Friday, we arose before 10:00, dressed in slacks, and awaited the arrival of Max. He had intended to take us in a friend's <unclear>camione</unclear> (station wagon), but the latter had not been returned form the garage at time promised, so we took a taxi. Then began another day, entirely different in every respect to any yet spent - a day of joy - pure joy. We climbed the Pyramid of the Sun, built by ancient Aztecs 2000 years ago. An immense structure, built in terraces, this has an altar of sacrifice on its summits, where</p>
(16)
<p>many thousands of bones haven't excavated What a thrill to look out over that landscape - and to feel the atmosphere of an ancient day. We had quite a time climbing it, and coming down as well for it, and coming down as well for it is extremely steep. At the base we took pictures, as we had on the ascent and the summit. Max caught a burro and we all took turns riding it. Bought a jade pin and a nice black stone carved for a ring. Tried to get pure uncarved jade without success - but I shall find it. The native children who sold us these spoke several words of English a surpresing amount snice it was all collected form passing "<unclear/>". We went then to see the temple of the Feathered Serpent Quetzllcoatl, God of the Aztecs - the principal one. I am enclosing pictures which will explain better than a thousand words. This temple is built with a huge arena, in the middle of which is a "muy grande" high, stage. Theories are many concerning the original use of these and it is interesting to imagine. You would love this, Daddy - or rather, you will, when you see it. After those several hours of great interest concentrated on such wonders, we were - very hung up! So Max took us in our taxi to a fas-</p>
