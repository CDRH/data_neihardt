Dear Friend:
We hope your plan to come on Friday March 31 will not hurry you too much, and we'll plan to have a quiety evening here at our home after we return with you from the 8:16 p.m plane. If you care to come on the one earlier in the afternoon that will be fine too - just let us know in time so we can be there to meet the plane you arrived on in January which was aobut 2 p.m.
If you can spare the time from Friday through to Wednesday p.m. I'm sure we can enjoy every minute of it, and we don't want to tire you with too many activities in any one day. We will be happy to take you to see any one or anything you wish while here, and we do want to invite friends in to meet you some time at your pleasure. I'll write you more about the plans for Sunday and Monday again soon - everyone is looking forward to all. Probably you have heard from Mrs. Nichol by now. I think she is planning the autography party for Tues. p.m. 
As soon as you can tell us the plan for anyone who may come with you, we will tell the  committees concerned so that places will be reserved at the "head table" at luncheon. We welcome Coralie again or anyone else you may care to bring. 
Sincerely
Julius D. Young 
p.s. I'm using  Centennial Stationary! JDY
