Dear Dr. Neihardt, 
I sat enthralled for 90 minutes last night as you reminisced with Dick Cavett. Had the program been 90 minutes longer it owuld have still been too short. An allotment of one minute per year of such an exciting and fascinating life is hardly sufficient. 
Having just graduated from college I have been a little regretful about leaving these good times behind. But after listening to you growing older sounds like a wonderful experience. I would be content with a lfie half as full as yours. 
I am absolutely in awe of what you have seen and done. You are a real inspiration to people my age. Thank you for living. 
I know the future can't be any kinder to you than the past, but best wishes anyway. 
Sincerely yours, 
Gary Pritchett
