<p>Dear John: &#8212; At last I am getting around to your good letter of Nov 9. How nice that you have a good riding horse! Now you can trounce over your acres the long comfortable way. Such a horse, &amp; one with a good disposition, too, is a treasure.</p>

<p>I heard from Potter. But he says that he has had no experience with that kind of book. He recommended to me a number of big houses. Mari Sandoz was also nice. She suggested some of the smaller publishers. She said that she sent the manuscript of Old Jules to fourteen publishers before she found one who would accept it. </p>

<p>I have made a summary of the <unclear>outline</unclear>, &amp; have had a number of extracts typed. I thought that such a sample might enable a publisher to determine whether or not he would be interested in reading the <unclear>whole</unclear>. I plan just after the vacation when the mails will be less crowded with letters &amp; parcels, to try again to write to a number of publishers.</p>

<p>We are having gorgeous weather; after an interlude of cold and a sprinkle of snow.</p>

<p>The bright colors, of course, are gone. The leaves are underfoot. Even so, there are muted &amp; quiet tones in the winter landscape that have their attractiveness At Thanksgiving, we rode down to Pennsylvania to see our younger daughter's family. What a beautiful region the Cumberland Valley is, how furtile and how shielded by <del/> the mountain walls on the North &amp; West. We were in the area across the river from Harrisburg.</p>

<p>I have just read a book that has given me new thoughts. Keyhoe Flying Saucers. Major Keyhoe of the U.S. Marines Ret. is head of an organization that is <unclear>hollering</unclear> to pierce the veil of secrecy that covers these phenomenon. He gives instance after instance of the appearance of these saucers, &amp; when he can gives the names of the persons who saw them. The whole showing gives impressive testimony of their existence &amp; on a level of technology far exceeding that we have &#8212; I think you would enjoy this book. The Library must have it. Ours does.</p>

<p>From time to time I still hear reports of your appearances being all favorable. And Nita &amp; I were so glad to have had the pleasure of having you in our home. Nita thanks you for reports on "Graham bread." As always,</p>
