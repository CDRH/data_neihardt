Dear Daddy and Mama,
<p>Rec'd your dear letter today, and read it on the street car on our way to the costumers, where we are beign fitted for our "Frankie and Johnnie" costumes. This is becoming quite an effective no. It is for popular appeal-done with "tongue in cheek" and a bit balletically too. Next we do <hi rend="underline">Persian</hi> dances, Oboy! We can't use "Capriccio Espagnol" for a while for Mexico might not like it! However, we shall soon be doing it.</p>
<p><hi rend="underline">So</hi> glad about all you say of Nat. Soc. Arts and Letters. Also I <hi rend="underline">shall</hi> ask Countess Thurday when she comes to see us.</p>
<p>Countess and our agent coming Thurday, our firend lawyer Friday (We go again to Chinatown!) and then <hi rend="underline">Sat.</hi> we perform and rehearse - Sun. we go to lawyer's home for music, perform again. <hi rend="underline">Then</hi> we leave Sun. night or Mon. morning for <hi rend="underline">St. Louis</hi>! (above) We will be home for about</p>
