Dear Gaki: 
Your typed "bulletin" came several days aga. We are thrilled with the news about the December 10th affair at Kearney. Of course, we re-issue our invitation for your to come by plane to Lincoln, or by car if one of your girls cares to drive up Saturday. Remember we have lots of sleeping room here for anyone. 
You oculd arrive Saturday, get a good night's rest and we would take you to Kearney in ample time Sunday for the evening program. We could stay in a motel at Kearney Sunday night if you prefer to not have the long drive back to LIncoln after night. We hope you can stay several days with us - lots of things to do and look over. We might be able to drive you back to Columbia if weather and  roads permit. Let us know you "flight plan" as soon as possible.

I told Art Ernst the good news about Kearney, and about the Compton request for your picture. He is so interested too. You mentioned request from Norfolk - is that from the new Christian College there? Hve you any more particulars yet? 
We have nice heat in the rental house now, and we are very slowly doing the necessary finish work that had to be delayed by the slow furnace men. We hope to have it ready for occupancy by Dec. 1. Rentals are slow this time of year here. 
We were interested in learning of your events with the Averys. We are so glad you are continuing to improve after your recent illness, and we sincerely hope you can come as planned. We are looking foreward to our next summer trip with you. Myrtle is writing to Prof. Gray about the phonography records. Hope the color snaps, 2"x2" slides and 8"x10" press prints reached you and your girls O.K. 
Sincerely Julius D. Young
