Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Today I received a shipment of your books from the University of Nebraska Press with your compliments. There were two copies each of the six paperbacks. I have having these vina-bound and placed in your toom as circulating copies. We can then restrict the hard copy first editions which are there.</p>
<p>Your books are so widely read that they do not last long. So it is good to have these additional copies. Thanks again for your thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to visit your room now that the Szasz portrait it there. I shan't soon forget our meeting and the "hanging."</p>
Very sincerely yours,
<signed>Ed.</signed>
