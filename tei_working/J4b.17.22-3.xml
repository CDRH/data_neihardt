THE ORDER OF BOOKFELLOWS
Tuesday Noon, Jan 7, '41.
Dear Ollie:
<p>I think we've seen our way now for that visit. I'll be through the hardest part of <underline>Jed</underline> this much, and I know I can do the rest in your basement. Mama wants to be with Enat now, and of course can help a lot in various ways. Also, she needs to be near all her kids. She should soon be through with the bust, and will be free to go.</p>
<p>We don't plan to save anything much by the visit, for we want to keep your household budget as is. Maybe I can stop our utilities &amp; save that much, and the coal &amp; would save would make some difference, of course. But we dont' especially want to save anything. I've used most of the cash I had when I was there, but I'll take in about $600 before we come, and so we'll be unthinkably wealthy again.</p>

<p>We want to be with you solely because we want to be with you - that's what I mean.</p>
<p>I'll bring the legs, dynamo, shaft, &amp; maybe a belt or two if I can find any around. Perhaps I've a grinding wheel or two that can't be used on hard stones. Mama wants to bring or send our electric washer too</p>
<p>We should be ready to get away not too, far from Jan 15th. I'm not sure of the time, but you'll hear, I'm looking forward eagerly.</p>
Love
Dad
