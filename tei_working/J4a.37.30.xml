Dear Mr. Neihardt:
The University of Nebraska at Omaha has recently created a School of Fine Arts, approved by the Board of Regents this semester. Included in the new School are the Divisions of Art, Music, Dramatic Arts, Dance, The Fine Arts Press, and The Program in Writing, UNO-Community Writer's Workshop.
To help celebrate the creation of this new union of the arts, the Divisions of the School are inviting guest artists in their respective disciplines to visit the campus. We in the Writer's Workshop felt there could be no better way to contribute to that celebration than by inviting Nebraska's most distinguished poet. 
It is for this reason that I write to ask if it will be possible for you to make an appearance at UNO this spring--perhaps in April or in the first part of May--to do evening of poetry readings from your work. The format for the program will, of course, be entirely of your own choosing. 
We look forward to hearing from you with the hope that we may begin making plans for your participation. 
Sincerely yours,
Richard Duggin
