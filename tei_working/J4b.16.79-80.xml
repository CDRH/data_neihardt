Precious Mona:
<p>The assembly program went off nicely. We will explode again at 8 P.M., and then we're on the way to Hiddenite where I'm sure not to find any. But an intelligent travelling man told me yesterday he'd just been through that county, adn that "They're finding everything there - even diamonds" So I'll have a thrill looking for some sort of cutting material anyway.</p>
<p>Looks snowy today, &amp; is spitting a bit out of a dirty <unclear>slay</unclear>. Maybe it's only a bluff.</p>
<p>Mighty, good of you to send the blankets. We hadn't needed them, but they may come in handy.</p>
<p>We're living in a girl's dormitory, and we just feel so awfully thrilled. Lovely room, two beds, desk etc. Automatic backhouse right in the apartment, and a big tub that is probably used for sailing boats in. Anyways it isn't big enought for a swimming pool.</p>
<p>We've had clear roads so far - no snow at all.</p>
<p>The Virginia folks seem especially folksy &amp; eager to be pleasant. it's very noticeable. I'd like living in</p>
80
<p>this country. 1500 feet alt &amp; beautiful landscape.</p>
<p>We had some honest to- God Virginia sugar-coated ham. Awfully good, but it isn't geared for my machinery. We've talked of bringing home a ham. If I can find a few diamonds <unclear/> sixe, we may bring a small ham.</p>
<p>I'm sure you're getting on well with the nymph, and I'll be eager to see it.</p>
Endless love,
Jno.
