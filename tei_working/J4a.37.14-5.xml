Dear Mr. Neihardt,
ans. 1-31-73
It has been my continuing enjoyment to know you through the years by way of your writings. I still hope to meet you personally - one age ninety-two gretting another age ninety-two. 
As one of Mr. Masters' English teachers in Central High School of Omaha I was asked to present your works to my pupils. It was a great pleasure to do so and it intro-duced me to a life-long interest in collecting all I coudl find on the West. 
Born at the edge of Minnesota and Dakota in a land shanty, I was in school during the blizzard of 1885. Tea-cher of our one-room school was Mr. Grant Martin who later became Attorney-General of Nebraska. My pioneering days were not unlike yours. 
After retirement in 1939 it became my chief interest to assemble works of Western history both for myself and for collectors in many states. The demand for your writings was great. Only in the past two years have I been obliged by health to give up this absorbing hobby. I do so admire your continuing energy and ability. Personally I no longer travel beyond our limited street, but I would be pleased
