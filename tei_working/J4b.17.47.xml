Dear Ollie &amp; Enot:
<p>We'll probably get away Thurs. morning &amp; stop in Springfield to do some things. May not arrive until Friday. We'll have quite a <unclear/> of stuff it seems. Glad you'll be home, Ollie.</p>
<p>I could go right ahead with my work if I knew I were staying here. But the awareness of a coming change always stops me.</p>
Love
Dad
