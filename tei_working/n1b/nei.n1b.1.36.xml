Dear Sir: 
I am very eager to find and obtain xerox copies of the following: 
1. Letters from George Sterling to John G. Neihardt
2. Letters from John G. Neihardt to George Sterling 
3. Letters exchanged between John G. Neihardt and Edwin Arlington Robinson 
4. Letters exchanged between John G. Neihardt and Volney Streamer, curator of the Players Club, New
York, during the first decade of the century. 
These were sold sometime between 1920 and 1930 through a well-known New York book dealer to an
institu-tion whose name I no longer recall. I am in the process of writing my autobiography and
would like very much to refresh my memory concerning these letters. 
I feel that you might have information regarding the location of such collections as this. Anything
you can do to help me locate these letters will be much appreciated. 
Sincerely yours, 
JGN:fmb John G. Neihardt
