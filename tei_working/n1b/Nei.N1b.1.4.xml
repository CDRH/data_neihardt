Dear Sir: 
I am trying to establish the exact location of the grave of Lieutenant George Wallace who was killed in the battle of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, against the Sioux December 29, 1890. I have the following quotation from the book by Robert M. Utley, entitled The Last Days of the Sioux Nation": 
"On the 7th of January the body of the gallant officer (Wallace), which had been sent ot his home in Yorkville, South Carolina draped in the flag of his troop, was buried with solemn ceremonies at that place. The schools of the town and many of the people joined in the funeral procession; and when the well deserved eulogies had been pronounced the local military body fired a salute over his grave." 
I personally have visited that grave, but I cannot remember the exact location and I cannot find the town of Yorkville on any of the available maps. Could it be that York, South Carolina, was once called Yorkville? Or could there have been a smaller establishment somwhere nearby by that name? 
Any help on this question that you can give me will be much appreciated. An intriging story lies behind my knowledge of Wallace's grave and I will be happy to tell it to you when we get this matter settled. I am inclosing a stamped, self-addressed envelope for your reply. 
Sincerely yours,
