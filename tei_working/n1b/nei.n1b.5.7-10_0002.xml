Dear Mrs. Nicolle:
I want to thank you heartily for your generous letter of August 23, 1973. Be sure that I shall prize
it. 
I am glad to know that you have taught and will be teaching some of my work to your students. I am
wondering what you have taught them thus far. Have you taught portions of CYCLE OF THE WEST? If so,
which ones have you taught? How about THE SONG OF HUGH GLASS or perhaps THE SONG OF THREE FRIENDS?
You might read portions of them and fill in with prose com-mentary. Have you read THE RIVER AND I?
Some of that might be pleasing to your youngsters. 
You made a great mistake, dear lady, in not speaking to me at Bancroft. I would have been delighted
to meet you. 
It may interest you to know that United Artists is bringing out records of me reciting my poetry.
The first album is due this month, and there should be as many as 12 albums. You might find these
records useful in your teaching. Why not try this?
With many thanks and all kind thoughts, your friend
John Neihardt
