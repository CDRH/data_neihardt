Dear Miss DeLowry:
Naturally I am interested in yoiur letter of May 21, 1973, regarding the doctoral dissertation you
are writing on my work. 
I am swamped with correspondence but I would be willing to answer certain definite questions tha
tyou might ask me. At present I am working on the second volume of my autobiography (the first being
ALL IS BUT A BEGINNING) and with the re-cording of my work by United Artists. There will be a series
of twelve albums, the first of which will appear in August. This has been a difficult and exhausting
job and is not completed yet. 
Make your questions as short and definite as you can make them and I will try to dictate concise
answers. 
Wtih every good wish,
John G. Neihardt
