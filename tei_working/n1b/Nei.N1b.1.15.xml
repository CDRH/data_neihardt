Mr. Bruce Nicoll
Lincoln, Nebraska 
Dear Bruce, 
It has been a long time since you and I have com-municated, and I am writing this more to say hello than anything else. I have been working steadily this winter on my book, The Old Man Remembers, and have made great progress. I am really having the time of my life doing the job. Even when I was recuperating from my eye opera-tions I continued to work--with one eye! 
That matter concerning the use of Hugh Glass material has come to nothing, although we were able to deal satis-factorily with the London firm. 
There is something special that I want to ask of you. I have long wanted to correct several lines in The Song of the Indian Wars, and I wonder if this cannot be done now so that the correction will be in any future printing. 
I suppose you have noted that we have had a good deal of publicity this winter--really quite remarkable. 
It seems now that I will have two fairly good eyes to use from now on. I am just now getting lenses. 
With all kind thoughts,
JGN:fmb John G. Neihardt
