Dear Sally McCluskey: 
Your letter of February 3 did not reach me at once as I was moving around. First of all there was
the Cavett interview (certainly a wow) and after that I gave a program to the Shawnee Mission School
in Kansas City - a big affair and another wow. Sicne you are my friend you won't mind my telling you
that for some reason or other I get standing ovations, always several of them. I think I would be
disappointed if it didn't happen although each time before I go before an audience I think it wonn't
happen. 
I am much interested in what you say about my work and your response to it. I am looking forward to
your Easter visit and I am sure you will hear from Mrs. Young. 
Yes, I wrote most of the crawl in an unheated room when the temperature frequently fell to 30 below.
Once that winter it was 40 below. 
I wish you would hug that boy pete for me and give the dog special pats for me. My Jacquot, who
barks French, sends you a number of joyful arfs because he likes anybody who is my friend. When I
leave him here with the Youngs he mourns the first four or five days. 
With every kind thought, your friend 
John G. Neihardt
