Dear Mildred: 
Excuse this typewriter. I am trying to catch up on my corres-pondence after being here and there. 
Yes, I was interviewed by Dick Cavett - for four hours on end and it was most successful. I'll tell
you something he said if you won't accuse me of bragging. In a interview with Arthur Godfrey he
stated brazenly that he thought I was the most in-teresting person he had ever interviewed. I did
tell you this not because I believe it but because it tells you how Dick Cavett feels. I would not
tell it if I did not know you are my friend. 
And I really don't believe it. 
It is good to hear how our young lady has developed. She is a sweetheart. 
I am very happy to know about your son's continuing success. 
Please say especially nice things to the Doctor for me. He and I used to "click" and would still if
we could be together. Finally, I rather like you, too!! 
With all good thoughts, your friend
John G. Neihardt
