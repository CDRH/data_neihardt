Dear old Friend,
I can tell you I was overjoyed to hear from you again; not that I thought you had necessarily gone on to your fathers, but that you had probably lost interest in me. I take it that you haven't, bless your heart: and I notice that you are even making a speech to some school about my work. In this connection, my friend, Mrs. J.D. Young, at whose home I^'m stay-ing while working on my autobiography, has sent you some material that will bring you up to date so far as my activities are con-cerned. 
I am astonished to realize that you are eighty years old, although I myself celebrated my eighty-eighth birthday this year. The material sent to you by Mrs. Young gives some interesting notes on this fact. 
Since I saw you I have completed an entirely new career, having taught seventeen years at the University of Missouri. I began at the tender age of sixty-eight and retired at eighty-five. It was a joy, all of it. I stayed year after year because I loved the students. My chief course was "Epic America," in which I gave my Cycle with commentary. The course was very popular. It is still running with the title "The Twilight of the Sioux." although I am far away: but I have a very able assistant, who takes care of my TV course. 
I think Mrs. Young has sent you enought material to hold you for some time. When you have survived it. please write me another letter. 
And believe that I still love you.

P.S. I am very glad to hear that you whipped a case of pneumonia, and I hope that it did not leave any bad results. I myself had a bout with virus pneumonia over a year ago, and there are no results. 
I do wish I could see you again. Surely it is still possible to do so.
