Dear Mr. Walker: 
Thank you for your assistance to my friend, Colonel Ralph Reed, last week in obtaining information on the location of the grave of Captain George Wallace, who was killed in the Battle of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, against the Sioux December 29, 1890. An intriguing story lies behind my knowledge of this grave, which I shall be glad to tell you when we get the matter settled. 
We shall certainly check the Nebraska State Historical Society for a copy of Francis Heitman's Historical Register Dictionary, as you suggested. 
Any additional information that you may be able to give me concerning Captain Wallace's burial will be most appreciated. 
Sincerely yours,
JGN:fmb John G. Neihardt
