My dear Miss Jacobsen:
Of course I am glad to copy the poem for your brother, Paul Jacobsen, since it seems to have been
written for him. It is to be found in my COLLECTED POEMS, published by the Macmillan Company last
November. 
EASTER 
Once more the northbound Wonder 
Brings back the goose and crane, 
Prophetic Sons of Thunder, 
Apostles of the Rain. 
In many a battling river
The broken gorges boom. 
Behold, the Mighty Giver
Emerges from the tomb! 
Now robins chant the story 
of how the wintry sward 
is Iitten with teh glory 
Of the Angel of the Lord.
His countenance is lightning 
And still His robe is snow,
As when the dawn was brightening
Two thousand years ago. 
O who can be a stanger 
To what has come to pass?
The pity of the Manger
Is mighty in the grass!
Undaunted by Decembers
Teh sap is faithful yet. 
The giving Earth remembers
And only men forget.
