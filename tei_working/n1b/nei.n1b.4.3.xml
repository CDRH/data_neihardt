Dear Friend Greg:
It was certainly a joy to hear from you, for I remember well my visit to Hawthorne. I believe that even my little dog Jacquot accompanied me on that visit and my memory of the whole affair is a happy one. 
It is especially interesting that you are attending school in Bloomington. My first "poem" so called was published in the Bloomington Eye when I was about 14 years old. Don't look it up. It is terrible but I did feel that you would be interested. 
I am enclosing a card bearing my autograph. 
Incidentally, it occurs to me that you might sometime be in Taylorville. I was born near there in 1881 and there is now a Christian County Historical Society there which features a collection of my work. The lady in charge is Miss Dorothy Drennen. I think a meeting between you two would be notable. 
Did you see the Neihardt-Cavett television show last year? You may want to know that it will be repeated on the ABC network on June 12. 
My autobiography, ALL IS BUT A BEGINNING, is being published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich of New York on September 20. No doubt it will be in your library. 
With affectionate thoughts, your old friend 
John G. Neihardt

P.S. I suggest tha tyou look me up in WHO'S WHO IN AMERICA and INTERNATIONAL WHO'S WHO. you will find these in your library. - J.G.N.
