Dear Miss Johnson:
I have received the various documents relating to the Order of the Indian Wars which you had received from Mr. Donnelly, and I want to thank you heartily for your efforts in my behalf. These documents will be filed with my Manuscript Collection at the University of Missouri and will be of value to many students in the future. When I began this search, I was thinking chiefly of the petition of 1923 with the signatures of General Miles, then Commander of the Order, and ten or twelve others. I know the original has been lost, but I had hoped to find a copy of it with the list of signatures. 
I have written Mr. Donnelly, thanking him for all he has done and expressing the hope that a copy of this petition may still be found. 
With all kind thoughts to you and your sister,
JGN:fmb John G. Neihardt
