Dearest Daddy!
<p>Tomorrow is your birthday. It would seem from the fact that I send <underline>just</underline> a letter that this so important day had taken me by surprise, but it is not so. I have waited for it to come.</p>
<p>It just so happens that the biggest gift I can offer you is the fact that I think of you many times every day in the year, that I love you with all my heart and cherish the thought that you are <underline>my</underline> Daddy. I think birthdays are more important than other days, for they allow one to concentrate just upon the birthday person.</p>
<p>I am so very happy that you are making such fine progress with "Jed Smith". I can not say how eager I am to get to read it when you are done. Who gets to thype the MS? If Eny, the <unclear>forward</unclear> one here to <unclear>me</unclear>, is not in shape to do the typing. <underline>I</underline> am putting in my bid for it now -</p>
<p>It was interesting to read your letter form Idwald Janes. There is no doubt that he is sold on your works and would put over a movie contract if he could. It would surely be a great thing. Here's hoping!</p>
<p>I have been so hung of late - almost too must so. Fortunately my voice is getting better. I am trusting that by tomorrow I'll be in shape really to sing.</p>
<p>It was more wonderful than I even can say to he even that short time with you. I am impressed every time I see you again with the post that you seem always more wonderful than before. You are so dear, so kind, so wise, and yet so strong. Perhaps I am just getting mroe able to appreciate.</p>
<p>Please write to me soon!</p>
With my every wish fo rthe best that could come to you in this new you - yesar, and with all my love,
your devoted
Hilda
