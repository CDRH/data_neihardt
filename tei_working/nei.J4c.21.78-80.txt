<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>I'm back from Cornell. It was extremely successful. I lectured three times - the main lecture on 
<hi rend="underline">Poetry as a Vocal Art</hi> with illustrations from my lyrics. The response was exceptional. They wouldn't let me go. That audience was composed of picked townspeople and faculty. I gave an hour on 
<hi rend="underline">The Death of Crazy Horse</hi> (with preliminary talk on the Cycle), and I heard a professor tell another, "They raised the roof". They really did, and I

had a hard time getting away. Then I gave an hour on "The Death of Sitting Bull". It was at least as successful as the others. Old Doctor W. A. Wilcox (97 years old and still bright) had special arrangements made to take him to the lecture hall. (He can hardly walk.) Sunday afternoon before I left Ithaca (Monday morning) he phoned me and said: "I must tell you that in all my academic career I have never before

been so deeply moved as by your reading of The Death of Sitting Bull". He is a living monument around Cornell, &amp; very distinguished in his field of Social <unclear>. Special luncheons every day, with <unclear>! They <unclear> carried me around.</p> 
	<p>I'm looking forward to the time at your home. We'll come to Skyrim too. It's beautiful! All the hedges are <unclear> full of

roses! I have Chapter VI. Will read &amp; return.</p>

	<p>Dr. Wichelus <hi rend="underline">was impressed</hi> with the lyrics lecture. He knows both of you, of course.</p> -<signature>Jno.</signature>
