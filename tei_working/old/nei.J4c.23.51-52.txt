<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	This is just a note on your lyric program, to be slipped in with my next letter. I'm in my office while my grader is conducting a test. You will follow through "from young love to married love." In doing this, perhaps you will find pertinent passages in <hi rend="underline">Gaea</hi>. I did mean all of that and it was all about Mona <hi rend="underline">before</hi> she came out to me. (I doubt that anything from <hi rend="underline">Nuptial Song</hi> can be used).
	Your plan is excellent. No one else has commented on that vital progression.

O, Lucile, <hi rend="underline">you do know</hi>! Your emphasis on "In the Night" means much to me. That happened so. All that summer we slept in hammocks under a cluster of cherry trees heavily laden with fruit. (The cherries ripening!) And I did see that in the starlight.
	But this is the chief point in my note: The progression goes farther, as you know - so much farther. This is expressed in the lyrics <hi rend="underline">as a high aspiration</hi>. And it <hi rend="underline">has</hi> happened to me. I'll never write a lyric about it, altho'<sic>although</sic> something of it should get into the poem, "I Shall Be Young with You" - if I am able to write it. It's really for the singing that is silence. But I could <hi rend="underline">describe</hi> it fairly well, for it is not vague. Its<sic>It's</sic> something like a radiation from an intensely living center, burning white, and making every living thing seem dear.

<hi rend="underline">Home</hi>

	This is the 18th of March, and now I have your letter. 1.- I am happy to know that Bower is gaining steadily. 2. Already I am admiring the lovely lavender dress that you will wear, with the amethyst, for the lyric program. 3. I am listening, too, and I know there is nothing but good to hear. In this connection: You once remarked that Enid has wisdom. Today, when we two had lunch together here she began talking with no prompting <hi rend="underline">about the most vital matters</hi>, and I wish you could have heard her. It was true and beautiful. <hi rend="underline">It could have been Mona talking</hi>. You should know her well. I marvel at her understanding and when she is in such a mood, she humbles me.
