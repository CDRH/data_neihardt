<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>That was a good and very welcome letter. You did, somehow, seem a bit far away. But you will all be here soon. Had some fine experiences last Thurs. (7-30-'59). Hilda &amp; I drove to Judge Hall's home on Lake Lotawana on Wed. p. m., and next morning we called on President Truman. He knew about me, in a general way, and especially in connection with Tom Benton. It was a happy 15 minute conversation we had, and we really <hi rend="underline">clicked</hi>. I forgot that he is a world figure and that he once had

more power than any Roman emperor ever had. He was <hi rend="underline">sweet</hi> with me, and in that short time I felt much ab out him that I'm glad to know. I really <hi rend="underline">saw inside by flashes</hi>, and I 
<hi rend="underline">loved what I knew</hi>. We shook hands twice as our group was leaving; and he came to the door, took my hand a third time &amp; said, "When I come to Columbia again I'll look you up." Look <hi rend="underline">me</hi> up! (Being important did not damage <hi rend="underline">his</hi> spirit.)</p>

places where I lived all under the age of 10 years. The places are all living, except the one at Howard &amp; Olive where I last saw my father. (The house next door is still hanging on wearily). The house at 2538 Wabash is now owned by a Negro preacher, Rev. Harris; and my god! You must see how he has dressed that place up! It's funny in a way that does not make you want to laugh. Evidently he loves the place not wisely and too well! He was not at home, but

I hope to see him and say something pleasantly appreciative. To think the old place should be so loved! Golly. I lived there 70 years ago, and it's all clear as yesterday afternoon. Our best friends, the Fincks, lived at 2540, and that, too is thriving with a new owner.</p>
	<p><hi rend="underline">And</hi>, Lucile, I stood under the windows of Miss Lobb's room at Irving School on 24th &amp; Prospect. It's a Negro school now &amp; the name is changed to Booker T. Washington. I've tried to get into the bldg., but could</p>
