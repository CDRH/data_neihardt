                <p>You did <hi rend="underline">much</hi> better that time! Thus far I have read your latest letter <hi rend="double underline">only four</hi> times, and it looks now as though I might be able to avoid a fifth reading. So the situation seems hopeful. But do be careful about writing too often. I haven't decided just what "too often" would be like, but I'd say that three or four times a week could be called rather frequent. Use your judgement.</p> <note type="authorial">Did I tell you about the Norwegian publisher who wants Black Elk Speaks?</note>

                <p>Good lawyers <hi rend="underline">are</hi> needed and they <hi rend="underline">can</hi> do a great deal of good. Old Man Stewart will make a good lawyer because he will be <hi rend="underline">a good man</hi>. I can fancy him as a very effective <hi rend="underline">trial lawyer</hi>, because he will have that quality called 
                    <hi rend="underline">presence</hi>. People will listen to him, <del/> feel that he is good, and so put faith in him. Here is a question for him to answer. It comes from Robin

                <p>When <hi rend="underline">should</hi> I come? Give me your idea. <hi rend="underline">"Your"</hi> as <hi rend="underline">dual number</hi> here. (How we <hi rend="underline">do</hi> need certain changes in English!) Will you have family (or other) company from the 26th of Dec to Jan 1? This question will give you a good excuse to write me at once (by air mail), and I'll not count it against you.</p> 
                   
                <p>I'm eager for your questions, and I hope you'll have many ready when I come. This visit should accomplish a great deal. We should have regular hours for the biography.</p>

                <p>It's the best record of the <hi rend="underline">voice</hi> thus far &#8212; really <hi rend="underline">very</hi> good. The Lyrics record is in preparation, and may be ready by 'Xmas. I'm glad you care to write the blurb for the back of the cover. Will you review the original comment on the lyrics, <del>as</del> along with whatever else you want to say? (This would be from the Bundle on through Man-Song.)</p>
                
                <p>I don't quite recall the Kiser you mention. It seems he knew that I didn't know Indians. Bless his heart! I hope his wife loves him!

                    And if she doesn't, I <del/> hope his dog does! As for Hazard, &#8212; <hi rend="double underline">eleven pages</hi> devoted to a tremendous effort to prove that I'm no good! What a waste of effort! As I remember, the lady knew all about Indians, didn't she?  <del/> Bless her heart too. I hope she is happily married. A critic at the time Hazard's book appeared dwelt on the absurdity of devoting eleven pages in a book to prove that the matter discussed wasn't worth discussing.</p>

                    opinion on this matter, and the consensus is very different from the Kiser or Hazard representations. Peden still says that the U of Mo. Press will publish the Lyrics &#8212; (not before the Fall of 1960.) Maybe it will be so.</p>
                
                <p>So you are about all <del/> painted and stained for the time being! I'll bet that home is a darling. It must be very lovely, How I want to see it!</p>

                    you had bronchial attacks. You were <hi rend="underline">not</hi> lying down, you were <hi rend="underline">erect</hi>, but I could not see below your waist, which merged with the dark. You could well have been sitting up in bed. You were as pretty as ever, but your face had a grayish look and you were a bit dark around the eyes.  <note type="authorial">You were enclosed in an oval of light and all about was darkness.</note> It <hi rend="underline">does</hi> seem odd that I should dream of you, sick or well, because I <hi rend="underline">never</hi> think of you at all except on those rare occasions when you disappoint me with an unwelcome letter!</p>

                    <p>You ask about my classes. <hi rend="underline">Epic America</hi> is the same as always. The attention is perfect, and some days I wonder why. (O the fine young faces!) My <hi rend="underline">Writing of Poetry</hi> class is a joy. We have fun and get lots of good work done. Six boys and <del/><add>three</add> women, two of the latter oldish. Some of the boys are remarkable &#8212; two often produce real poetry. The women are good too, as always; but this time it's the boys who do the finest work. They are all darlings, and I love to be with

                <p>I was invited to be a guest of honor at the 25th anniversary dinner of the Academy of American Poets helt last Wednesday in the great ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria. As a guest of honor I was to "sit on the <del/> dais". There were 1000 guests in all, and the Sec. of the Treasury of the U. S. made the chief speech. Another speech was made
