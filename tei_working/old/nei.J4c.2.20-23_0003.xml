when I get farther along with the "Song of Hugh Glass" I'll give you a copy if you want it. Have 500 <unclear> now - and I believe I'm succeeding. There will be about 1500, and yet the thing is closely wrought. It's a big story, worth elaborating. I'm doing the thing simply + it flows.
    
Did you know <unclear> gave miss Moural + her fat donkey a gentle drubbing? He did. She sent me the bitter last signing!
    
Say, The Bestow Poetry journal out to live, because it stands for the real thing as much it can. <unclear> tells me he's having hard sledding with it - at least he suggests as much.
    
So long for the moment. Luck to you! Big Brother!
