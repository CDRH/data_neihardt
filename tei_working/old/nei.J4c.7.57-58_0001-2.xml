718 Webster Street, Palo Alto, California. Nov. 2, '21.

Dear Seymour:-

I'm visiting here during a gap in my lecture tour. I'll be here <unclear></unclear> Nov. 15, when I'll do a stunt at Stanford. After that I shall be on the jump until Dec. 12 among the universities + colleges of the northwest.

I'm going to need the Laureate address on Nov. 15th. If you have not already sent proofs to Branson, please send them here. If The Torch Press can't furnish proofs to you by the 10th <unclear></unclear>. I'm going to have to ask that you have the MS sent to me in time for my Stanford engagement. I'm sorry to be obliged to do this; but you're a good scout, + I'm sure you'll do anything reasonable for me as I most certainly would for you.

With ever fond thought,

Yours,

John G. Neihardt
