Dear Lucile:

	<p>I've just heard that Rex Carey died a day or so ago. My last letter to him arrived just before or just after his going. I hope it arrived just <hi rend="underline">before</hi>, because in that letter I told him that he was dear to me. I've written his wife. Old Rex sent me two letters I wrote

-2-

him 50 years ago!! He cherished them all those years. I aim to send them on to you, and will soon. I still dislike you and your family.</p>
