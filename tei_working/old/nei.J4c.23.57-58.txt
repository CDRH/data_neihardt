	We're having weather! Snow yesterday, alternating with drizzle. A thunderstorm last evening -then more snow through the night! The highways are a mess this morning; but I must get out to the TV station this p. m. and I will, I'm sure. I'm giving this week to <hi rend="underline">The Messiah</hi>, and I love it.

really get the meanings. I can give only three sections - The Coming of the Word; Wovoka's Vision; and Wounded Knee. After this week I'll cease to twinkle, twinkle little star! I'll miss the experience. Next time we'll probably have 1 hour periods, and that will be bully.
	Robin and I will see you three in Feb. if the planes fly - and they will. Perhaps by that time there'll be an unseasonably warm spell - violets and dandelions and robins. Max &amp; Sig are on the way home, Max driving. Sig is doing well!

					With love to you Three
