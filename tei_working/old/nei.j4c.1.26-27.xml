<salute>Dear Davis:-</salute>
</opener>
	<p>In the matter of the cabin up in the Hills, I want
to say that my mother will be there, and she can cook stuff
that tastes as good as anything I ate at Sherry's while in
your village. As to the bath, you could take a tumble into
our trout stream most any evening, and I think I could
enjoy such a souse better than I did several Turkish baths
I got in little old Manhattan. If you insist, I will have
a phonograph up there to play you to sleep (?) every night
with the choicest selections from light opera.</p>
	<p>The book will be out the 25th of this month, and Davis
gets one of them before the mucilage is dried!</p>
	<p>You ask why I don't send in any more short stories.
I have been doing a series of stories for the American
Magazine, and have already dragged $600 out of them for
four stories. I want to make them part with a few more before
I let go. They are giving me the best illustrators.
Several other magazines have been asking me to contribute,
kindly explaining to me why it would be to my advantage to 
appear in their pages. I don't want to force my stories.
They must grow naturally. I have a few of my old stories
yet to be published, and after that everything I do must
be strong. And, believe me, it will be so.</p>
	<p>As you know, I am not the sort of a cuss to write
often for Munsey's. They require stories that I can't 
write without cramping myself. They do not allow the real

language of real men in their pages. In the "Alien" they 
rather disfigured my leading character by making him
say "dern" and "darn" when no such character ever spoke
in that way. I don't blame them at all; I know they are
obliged to do this for the sake of their readers. But I
don't like it.</p>
	<p>I have no objection to the manner in which my stories
have been printed in the other Munsey publications; but
I am aware of the fact that you are not allowed to pay
as much for stories as I can get elsewhere.</p>
	<p>This is written personally to Robert H. Davis, the
friend of the Little Buffalo. You are the man who gave me
a start in New York, and you are the last man in the world
who would want me to stand in my own light.</p>
	<p>I might turn out a Munsey story most any time; and
you bet I'll trot it around to the Flatiron for inspection
when it gets on paper. The stories I am doing now could
not possibly get into Munsey's; and this is nothing
against either Munsey's or the stories.</p>
	<p>You see where I stand, don't you?</p>
	<p>I believe I'm going to win ultimately, for I can feel
big stories trotting about in my head. When I do win, be sure
that I will remember the man who took me in when I was a
stranger. That's you.</p>
