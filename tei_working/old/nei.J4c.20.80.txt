<p>Dear Slade Kendrick:</p>

	<p>We haven't communicated often of late, but you are in my thoughts very often, and you are dear to me - one of the very dearest of friends. I just want to say hello, and bless your heart! <hi rend="underline">Bless both of you equally in that house of yours where I was happy!</hi> Mona and I share the feeling here expressed.</p>

                             <p>Yours always,</p>
