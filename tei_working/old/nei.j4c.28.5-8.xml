                <p>I was so glad to hear from you as always. But I wonder why you seem so far away, and why you seem to be getting farther and farther away. This may be wholly subjective and I hope it is (Lately I've had to struggle against a 
                <hi rend="underline">lost feeling</hi>).</p>
                
                <p>Yes, yes, you must know more about my mother. She had a long, hard fight, and she was so brave. It gives me a heart-ache to remember, and I do wish I could pet her and tell her some things that would make her heart sing. Of course, towards the end of her life, she

                <hi rend="underline">did</hi> have satisfactions, and I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> look after her &#8212; Mona and I. But, my god! I've things to say to her that I never knew enough to say when she was here.</p>
               
                <p>It's good of you to try to interest your English Dept. chairman in my poetry. Unless he is 
                <hi rend="triple underline">highly exceptional</hi>, he is under the influence of the going time-mood, and my work will not affect him in the least. It <hi rend="underline">is</hi> amazing what <hi rend="underline">is</hi> accepted as significant poetry in our day! But maybe your man <hi rend="underline">is</hi> highly exceptional. Anyway, bless his heart! It doesn't

                Does it?</p>
                
                <p>Next Saturday (this Wednesday) we will get all the floors mopped, the rugs <del/> &amp; furniture back in place at Skyrim. I'm planning to be there after May 1st, and Mona Fink will stay with me &amp; keep the house straight. She had her mother ask me if she could have that job!! She invests all her money in Savings and Loan at 4%!! I wish I were looking forward happily to my living out there. I feel somehow, that I <hi rend="underline">should</hi> be there.</p>
                
                <p>Last Saturday I went to St. Louis with Albert, who took his final.
                    
                    <pb facs="nei.j4c.28.5-8_0002b"/>
                    I stayed with old P-D friends, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ward Moore. They are dear! I barged in unexpected at 9:30 a. m. and they were still in bed. But they were as happy as I was, and Mrs. Moore actually embraced this poor old man! We had a happy time, and I reached home at 2 a. m. Sunday.</p>
                
                <p>Today I talked to about 75 third-grade children at a west-end school. Mrs. Frances English is the teacher. The <hi rend="underline">dear, dear,</hi> <hi rend="italic">dear</hi> kids!! I had a fine time
                
                <fw type="curatorial">6</fw>
                    <pb facs="nei.j4c.28.5-8_0003a"/>
                with them, and they were very happy. Many many crowded around me afterward and <hi rend="italic">thanked</hi> me. The precious kids! I talked about Indians (wow!) and I was happily surprised at what they knew about other Indians than mine. Mrs. English must be a very remarkable teacher. I was greatly impressed by those youngsters.</p>
                
                <p><del>Robin has</del>
                    Robin has a pup!! It's a registered golden Collie, and, my goodness gracious, golly, what a 
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4c.28.5-8_0003b"/>

                big, big dog it is for its size! At least as big as Perky, I bet you! And I bet Perky is <hi rend="underline">awfully</hi> big by now! Robin calls his pup <del><unclear>Robn</unclear></del>"Robin's Scotch Lady" &#8212; "Lady" for short. (The long name is for registration).</p>
                
                <p>I wish I could be as good and lovable and altogether worthy as Perky and Lady certainly are! </p>
                
                <p>I'm hoping Bower <hi rend="underline">will</hi> call me &amp; maybe let us feed him out here. Surely he <hi rend="underline">will</hi> call me. </p>

                    <p>I will spend the month of June <del>folo</del> following the horses through Tenn., Kentucky, Georgia, &amp; Mississippi. Alice &amp; Cook will be showing their best ones, and I'll go along. What fun! As I get older, I feel closer and closer to <del/> the four-legged animals. There's a great deal that I am feeling and thinking at this moment that I'll never write down. I 
                <hi rend="underline">do not</hi> believe the feeling I have is common, and I think it has a tremendous

                significance.</p>
                
                <p>In St. Louis, Ward Moore and I visited two bookstores. They knew me both places, and a fan of mine was browsing in one store. <hi rend="underline">He</hi> didn't know me until introductions. He was a retired <del/> professor &amp; he surely knew my stuff &#8212; quoted a string of it!</p>
                
                <p>I found Stewart Edward White's last book &#8212; the third in the "Betty" series! <hi rend="underline">The Betty Book</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Across the Unknown</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">The Unobstructed Universe</hi>. It's a great book, as the others are too.</p>
