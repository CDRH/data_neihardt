<p>Dear Mrs. Aly:</p>

	<p>I want this to reach you before you start for Minneapolis. I had an office in the old Journal bldg on 4th St from Sep 1, 1912, to March 1 (I believe) 1913. During this time I ran a weekly page. After that I did my work (a weekly column) in Bancroft, and, after 1921, in Branson. Be sure to go over the <hi rend="underline">weekly page</hi> first. There must be some amusing ones in this group, as I recall how old H. V. Jones used to come into my office chuckling to say, " Well, you had another hat one!" I remember "Sentimental Geometry" and

"Wanted: A Barrel of Arnica"; but there must have been a considerable number. I think there may be some on the outburst of impressionism in 1912. That would be the early beginning of my thesis which was elaborated in the Journal-Post and, most of all, in the Post-Dispatch.</p>
	<p>You mention my "reading" to the children. It was <hi rend="underline">recitation</hi>. I used to "sing poetry" to them, as they called it. "Sing poetry, Daddy; sing poetry". I did a lot of that.

Did you find the verses to Davis, ending "Of you, 'tis, I'll be thinking when I blow off the foam"? I vaguely recall those you mention. Yes, you certainly are right about <hi rend="underline">Mignon</hi>. Nature knows nothing of morals - an obvious fact that in no way lessens the social value of morality or the spiritual value either. Beneath the troubled surface there are the unchanging depths - the universal mother - the <hi rend="underline">"Ewige Weibhichkert"</hi> (Goethe's

expression). My <hi rend="underline">A Vision of Woman</hi> is on this theme. I assumed the Indian felt this instinctively and experienced something of the old, old, worship.</p>
	<p>We'll be seeing you and the Doctor!</p>
