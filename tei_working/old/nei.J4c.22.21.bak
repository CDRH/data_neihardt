<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	I'm wondering if you may be sick, or if a letter was lost here. Bob Kelly died several days before election. He was running for state auditor. A fine man, and a friend. Affectionate thoughts for each of you and all of you together.

the great old and lamented Boston Transcript. His long article on <hi rend="underline">Glass</hi> was the best that appeared. He is still living. Only recently he issued some anthology: If you should write him, asking him to comment on the matter, I believe you would get something you could use, - something of the "time-mood" that can carry over only through personal reminiscience. You'd know how to express your desire.
