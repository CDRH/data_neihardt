<salute>Dear Comrade:-</salute>
</opener>

<p>I'd forgotten to tell you the following, which I think you'll enjoy, and I'll tell it now before I forget it for good.</p>

<p>Munson drove down here in late August, spending a day and two nights. He has been "taking" literature at the Uni. (I don't mean anything uncomplimentary to him or anyone else. The idea always tickles me - that's all). Well, he told me that Doctor Stuff got up before the class one day and said that he wanted to make a confession to that class concerning his former attitude towards my work. He said that for years he has thought much of it, probably because he didn't know it. Finally one day (he had evidently been hearing a great deal in the meanwhile) he decided he would get my stuff, take it home and find out what was in it. "And I was astonished. It is wonderful." This is Munson's account, and I have it only from him.</p>

<p>Isn't it amusing? And, also, isn't it an indication of fundamental honesty in Stuff? That is the time-honored professorial attitude that brings the professors, as a class, in for so much condemnation from creative types. You are a professor, but you have escaped that. However, if you had been trained <hi rend="underline">long and hard</hi> by any of making "English" a specialty, God only knows what a poor teacher of "English" you might be now. As it is, you know that there is no teaching of literature <hi rend="underline">except what happens as a result of enthusiastic appreciation communicated by contagion.</hi> That is what will make you a powerful hand of an English Department.</p>

<p>God help the scholastic. The world is greatly hindered by the ignorance of scholars. Understanding is everything. You will save souls for the army of the angels - a small army, but it is better to be whipped in that army then to

<postscript><p>Sherman is a dear old scholar. One grows fond of him. I know he's wrong somewhat on the side of <hi rend="underline">mechanism</hi>, but he's a ripe old man, and I honor him. Also, he's surprisingly open to young ideas now, or certainly seems to be. I am so glad I can feel as I do towards him - and towards stuff too. The latter has shown a warm heart, and that's always a tremendous thing.</p>

<p>But, good comrade, no man's face glows as yours does with the light of any vision or any flash of insight. It is the memory of such moments of <hi rend="underline">understanding without words.</hi> That make me love you - even more than your unselfish work for me + my stuff. <hi rend="underline">To see through</hi> is everything; and when that look comes over your face, you are seeing through.</p></postscript>
