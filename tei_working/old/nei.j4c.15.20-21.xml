                <salute>Dear Comrade:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>It was really bully to feel the joy in your recent letter about the January Number. I am so glad you hit upon the very fine idea of conducti<del>on</del><add>ng</add> this magazine. It is good not only for others, but for you. I'm looking forward eagerly to seeing the latest issue, as I needn't tell you. I don't know that I have said enough about the various numbers as they have reached me, but I have rejoiced none the less, and the fact of your running this magazine is one of the very good things that I know. I can't think of a list of persons to whom I want copies sent, but I'll think of perhaps four or five or a half-dozen soon.</p>
                
                <p>I have not sent you the little booklet you wanted, because I have not been able to find a copy.</p> 
                
                <p>Have you written to THE NATION as you said you might? I really think that not much of what is <hi rend="underline">said</hi> nowadays really matters long. The popular consciousness is too hysterical to be much impressed by anything that is said. It is a matter of gratification to me, however, to note how many subtler indications of the living quality of the stuff I've written continue to turn up. Two or three things of this sort are certain to happen in any week and are likely to come from anywhere in the country. They take the form of request<add>s</add> for autographs, expressions of appreciation, passing references to my work as though they were a part of the scheme of things, and always the plane of regard seems high. Naturally, I don't mention these things

                    to you as they happen, but if you were around here I am sure you would often have that glow on your face that I love to see.</p>
                
                <p>I suppose you are having spring there as we are here. In fact, winter in this country is never really more than six weeks long. Most of the year is either early in the spring or late in the fall. It is a great country to live in. I wish there were some way for us to be closer together. While I am wishing I might as well wish that you could be living here and running your magazine, but of course that is only a lovely dream.</p>
               
                <p>I'm definitely planning to go to the Sioux Reservation in April, and it seems that I may lecture at most of the state normals in Nebraska as I pass through. Dr. Conn wants me to do this.</p>
