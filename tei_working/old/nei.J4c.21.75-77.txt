<p>Dear Lucile &amp; Bower:</p>

	<p>Thanks for the invitation to be a guest in your home after June 8. I will return from Yankton about June 7, and then I can come to you for a week or more I think this is a good plan, as it will save you much coming and going. I do hope, however, taht we may be at Skyrim once or twice. If we give our time to the job, much can be done in even one week.

Alice &amp; the children will be leaving (with a load of horses) next Wednesday. (This is Sunday). I'm glad I can tell the children I'll be coming down to them in a short while.</p>
	<p>I'm reading the <hi rend="caps">MS</hi> - Chap IV. <hi rend="underline">Good job</hi>! Two or three corrections as to facts - easy to make. Will pass the <hi rend="caps">MS</hi> on to Dr. Reid.</p>
	
					<p>Affectionately,</p>
