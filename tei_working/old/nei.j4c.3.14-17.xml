<salute>Dear Old Man: &#8212;</salute>
</opener>
	<p>I'm ever so grateful for the copy of "Yosemite", and I needn't tell you that I admire it. It has the Sterling quality. When are you going to tackle "Lillith"? There's a great theme for just you, and really the time has arrived when you owe it to yourself to work out the idea. I can't tell you how thoroughly I am convinced that you must do that thing, &amp; soon. It will furnish the mass to back up your briefer things. One must fear the attack on posterity, a cavalry charge is superb &amp; may be very effective in a small area; but you want the solid wall of infantry somewhere in the rear. And I have all the faith in the world that you can general a large body. I'm talking as though I owned you &#8212; and in a sense I do. Stagger them with sheer weight combined with skill! Do "Lillith" somewhat as you suggested it to me here.</p>
	<p>Say, Sterling, there's a wistful sort of a lovable cuss here who is bats on <hi rend="underline">shells</hi>. He has really a very nice collection already; but I was wondering if in your rambles along the shore you might be able to find some unusual shells for him. He would cherish them especially as coming from you. It's a good chance to give pleasure

<pb />

to a fellow who hasn't much. What can you do about it? Half a dozen unusual shells would put him in the seventh heaven &#8212; or even one.</p>
	<p>I'm going to the Markham dinner at Ann Arbor early in November. Your friend, Hyatt, is the instigator as you probably know already. I wish you were in <unclear>striking</unclear>  distance.</p>
	<p>Macmillans have announced "Hugh Glass" &amp; I am now reading plate proofs.</p>
	<p>Would you consider letting Macmillans issue a volume of your finest? I've been thinking about that a good deal of late. You'd have no difficulty in that direction, being so far above many they already publish. If you'd care to consider the matter, I'd be happy to broach the subject to Marsh, providing some of your more influential friends didn't do it. I couldn't do it right now, but sometime during the Winter I could. If this seems impertinent, charge it to my deep appreciation of Sterling.</p>

<salute>Always yours,</salute>

<postscript><p>My composer friend, Kreider&#8212;a fine chap, tried to see you at Caramel; but you were evidently lost at the moment.</p></postscript>
