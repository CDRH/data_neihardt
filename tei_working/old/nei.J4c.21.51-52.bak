<p>Dear Mrs. Aly:</p>

	<p>Before I forget, here is another note on the "flaming" socialist "paradox".</p> 
<hi rend="underline">Paradox</hi> is right, as you say; and a bit later you show that you meant 
<hi rend="underline">paradox</hi> and not <hi rend="underline">discrepancy</hi>. In one of my articles I pointed out the discrepancy between the radical socialist position of certain alleged poets of <hi rend="underline">the masses</hi> school and their <hi rend="underline">anarchic</hi> theory of poetry. The social position connoted an insistence on a high state of organization, forming but in the arts they were violently opposed to form, technically and philosophically.</p>
	<p>This is a good point.</p>

			<p>Kindest -</p>
