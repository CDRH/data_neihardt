<p>Dear Slade:</p>

	<p>Your dear letter means everything to me. Bless you. All you say is true, and I am so glad you wrote about the <hi rend="underline">glow of spirit</hi> in her face. It was so strikingly characteristic that even strangers have remarked about it. It was the spirit shining through. (She had been preparing to go for a long while - getting things straightened out - boxes &amp; barrels of papers &amp; trinkets - all our rings made

strong for the children. A ring had lost a diamond. That had to be reset, because the ring would go to Sigurd after I was through wearing it. She gave me orders about the funeral long before her illness. All this was done with no hint of morbidity. We <hi rend="underline">believed together</hi> and we <hi rend="underline">knew</hi>, and I <hi rend="underline">know</hi>. I told her that when the time should come, I wanted her to go first. I did not want her to go through the

earthly suffering of the change. So she has gone ahead, and I will do my best as long as I am needed here.</p>
	<p>The funeral was beautiful - masses of flowers. A minister friend of mine spoke. Then 
<hi rend="underline">I spoke directly to her</hi> for 3 minutes &amp; read three lyrics. She had asked me to read. Then our boy, Sigurd, the pianist, played a Bach prelude that she loves.

And our daughter Hilda sang gloriously a song Mona loves. She was with us and <hi rend="underline">is</hi>.</p> 
	<p>I must answer your question about the title of my lecture. Let's call it <hi rend="underline">Poetry as a Vocal Art</hi>, illustrated by readings of his own lyrics. The poetry will win over those who come, but how to induce them to come -? A doctor's thesis is now being written on my reading of poetry. And, of course, I've read for years to audiences all over the country. The lyrics <hi rend="underline">always</hi> won them over.</p>
	<p>This is the best I can do just now. If you think it proper, you may use these facts: I'm a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters; a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets (N. Y.); Vice-Pres (for the Midwest) of the Poetry Society of America; a fellow (recently selected)

	<p>This sounds boastful. I'm just trying to give you some support in your task of promotion.</p>
