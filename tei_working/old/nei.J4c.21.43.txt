<p>Dear Edna:</p>

	<p>Many thanks for your letter. I remember when you were born. Many years ago (maybe 25) did you not call me on the 'phone when I was lecturing somewhere in western Nebraska or South Dakota? I feel that you are a woman with lots of courage. Bless your heart!</p>
 
                          <p>Your friend</p>
