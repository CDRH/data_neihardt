<p>Dear Comrade:</p>

	<p>That last letter to the gentleman is a dandy and I'd hate to receive one like it with equal justification. It will be interesting to see what sort of reply you receive.</p>
	<p>The idea about an article for PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION sounds good to me, and I do hope you may care to write the other article entitled " The Making of a Myth". Where did you think of publishing the latter? It might not be a bad idea to try SATURDAY REVIEW through William Rose Benet. Or Boston Transcript through the lit. ed. who is a true believer, I gather.</p>
	<p>I suppose you are still having your second spring just as we are here.
	<p>I'm looking forward to April when Enid, Hilda and I will go up for the pow wows<sic>powwows</sic> with Black Elk and his friends. Did I tell you that I have signed the contract with Morrow? The manuscript is to be delivered no later than November 31. I'll have it ready before September.</p>
		<p>Nothing much to say from here just now.</p>

					<p>With love always,</p>
