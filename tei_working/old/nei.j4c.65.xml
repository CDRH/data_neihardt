Dear Seymour:-

It has struck me that if there are a few really bad errors in the "Address", it would not be much of a job to make correction in ink as the books go out. I am thinking of one errors, really - "institutional philosophy" for "Institutional philosophy". This is pretty bad, but you may have caught it.

Let me have the earliest copy and I'll go over it at once and point out anything really bad by return mail.

I'm sorry that the proofs were ready when I was so far away; but doubtless it will come out all right.

Yours,

John Niehardt

The growth of the Order delights me! Do you know anything about the Book + Drawn Club or Society of Chicago? It <unclear></unclear> headed by one of the big men in Sears <unclear></unclear>. They want me, so <unclear></unclear> tells me. Do you know what they'll stand in the way of a fee?

If it happens they <unclear></unclear> got the approval material in, I shall be glad after all. There's a good + new idea there.
