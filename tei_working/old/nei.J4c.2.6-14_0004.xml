is anything odd about raising <unclear>, corn, hogs, with a Greek <unclear> of Homer in one's <unclear> pocket and nebulous poems in one's head? It can be done, for I have done it. God knows the world never asked for poets-though it be proud of them when it is too late. I ask nothing from society, but my fighting chance. I will do the rest. But I must have the fighting chance, and I will fight to get it.

A wife? - You mention a wife. What should one do without her? I have one, and a baby. Women have the genius for faith - real women. It was partly <unclear> to talks at my wife that I wrote you when I did.
