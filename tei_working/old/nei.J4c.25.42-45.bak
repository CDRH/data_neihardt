<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>Yours of the 15th, with a welcome "amen" by Bower, came today just after I mailed a letter to you. I had been "thinking about you and thinking about you" and making letters and letters that did not reach the mail; and I thought I wouldn't wait any longer.</p>
	<p>What you said about my writing in the shed (<hi rend="underline">cool</hi>) shed at my mother's place reminds me of something that meant much to me at the time. I wrote "Prayer of an Alien Soul" in that shed. My "study" was a tiny portion of the shed that had a 

-2-

rude raised floor. It was no bigger than 4 x 5 ft. There was a window (no glass) and it was opened, there was some light in the place - enough to write by. There was a weed that came up through a crack in the floor. I watched it with great interest and sympathetic understanding. It was <hi rend-"underline">white</hi> from lack of light, and it was fighting its way up to that window and the broad day outside. <hi rend-"underline">It made it after a long struggle</hi>!

It was a long, stringy, pale weed, but it took on color when it had reached the Day! Look in my "Prayer of an Alien Soul" &amp; you'll find the weed. (Incidentally, I <hi rend-"underline">meant</hi> what I said in that Prayer. Lucile, 
<hi rend-"underline">I still mean it! Do you understand me?</hi></p>
	<p>Yes, the "Funny Place" (now covered by the fine, new expensive dwelling) was very important. It was a place of <hi rend-"underline">Wonder</hi>.

In that place, mystery took over and the best was true. We just sort of thrilled together in that place - the kids and I. We did that for years afterwards too. In this connection I remember an enchanted night in our pasture at Branson. It was a cold (woooo!) night, but we thought it would be a good idea to go down into the pasture under a tree that was an old friend of ours, build a

rousing fire and "<hi rend-"underline">sing poetry"</hi>. So that is what we did - Enid, Hilda, Alice &amp; I. At the time we had a Jersey cow, an Angora billy goat, a horse, a cat, and a collie dog. They were all a bit "fey" themselves (which is to say, pleasantly &amp; harmlessly "nuts") and they all came down to our big fire, which they surrounded, 
<hi rend-"underline">heads in</hi>.

I'm so glad Bower added that "amen". Maybe he will write me a whole letter; maybe he might care to tell me something of his constructive dreams! (Here I remember old Socrates - bless him! - and what he said to his judges, according to Plato. While he was waiting for the verdict, which he knew would be death - he saw no reason why they should not sit together as friends and 'tell each other their dreams.' Well, we too know the verdict of <hi rend-"underline">this world</hi>, and we know it is the "dreams" that matter). Yes, Lucile, the letters are better than nothing - O so much better! But there's <hi rend-"underline">so</hi> much to <hi rend-"underline">say</hi>. Endless affection to each of you,</p> <signature>John</signature>
