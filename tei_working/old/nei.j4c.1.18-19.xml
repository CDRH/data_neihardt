<salute>My dear Mr. Davis:&#8212;</salute>
</opener>
	<p>I have just read <choice><sic>you</sic><corr>your</corr></choice>  last letter again, and it seems 
to me now that I must have answered it in a way that shall seem
light to you.</p>
	<p>It was written in a hurry, as I was leaving town, and 
I think I must have overlooked a paragraph in your letter.
You say that you think what I need is a larger audience &#8212; a
few more people who understand me for my own sake.
I am deeply grateful to you for saying that, for you hit upon
that which I feel with considerable bitterness at times.
This is the sort of conversation which might be heard in
this town concerning me "What do you think of that Neihardt?"
"O, rather queer in his ways!"</p>
	<p>Vermin! My best speaking must always be to myself.
I am forced to guard myself in talking before this sort of
people. A lot of sordid little shopkeepers who never read!</p>
	<p>I don't think for a minute that I should be any more than
a very tiny taper in the midst of a conflagration back there;
but at least I could see some light.</p>
	<p>You know what these Western towns are, don't you? The people
are all right, they have nothing to do with my business.
I don't think for a minute that I am so lofty that I am
misunderstood; I am simply out of place here; I'm an alien,
and always have been. I wish to God I could get among my people.
I'm not a whiner; I've stuck to my Gleam about thirteen years
in the worst of circumstances, and I have done some good work -
some that is still in manuscript - most of it, in fact.
But did you ever notice the alien cry in most of my stuff that
you have read? There's a reason for that.</p>
	<p>I believe, Davis, that if I don't get cut down for ten years
yet, I'll make some of the fossils out here discover that
I'm alive. A man who has scrapped his way up from the sage-
brush, as you have, can not fail to sympathize with that sort
of egotism. <hi rend="underline">You know!</hi></p>
	<p>I'm writing this extra letter to let you know how very
deeply I appreciate your understanding me and caring about my
future.</p>
	<p>When my friend Streamer gets back to your town he will call
on you. I have discovered that he intends making it the object
of his life to see me placed. <hi rend="underline">He</hi> wouldn't tell me this. What
do you think of such a man? Since he is that kind of a man,
I shall send him to you, for he will understand me, detecting what 
is false in me and still not missing what is true. He shall be the 
tertium quid between us &#8212; for I want to know you; you were the first

to reach a hand to me.</p> 
	<p>Sometimes I smoke myself black in the face with impatience.
I have often felt like a fellow marooned on an uncharted island
of wild goats. Blat, blat, blat! I don't know for certain
yet which of us is the wiser; I only know that we don't mix well.</p>
	<p>Two volumes of my stuff are in London getting the look-over;
have been there almost three months. They might snatch me out 
of this; but I have quit taking Fate by the forelock.
I wait. But God! what a lot of good tobacco I spoil while
I wait.</p>
	<p>But you never can tell &#8212; and I'm not dead yet.</p>
	<p>Thanks again for your great kindness in caring about 
me at all.</p>

<salute>Most sincerely yours,</salute>
