Dear Slade:

	<p>Bully to hear from you again! Surely I wrote you about being with you Oct. 19, didn't I? It's a good time, and I can arrive at the beginning of the week, Oct 16. We had a mild winter here until Feb. 20. Then the snow began and we had more than I ever saw here before. It's gone now, and there's a lot of green grass for the precious horses.
	This is Monday p. m., and Hilda, the kids &amp; are going out to Skyrim to put up pictures, arrange rugs. I'll write again soon. Kindest thoughts to Nita, and all affection to you -</p>
