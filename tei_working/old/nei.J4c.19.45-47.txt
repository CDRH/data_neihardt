<p>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Berg:</p>

	<p>It was good indeed to hear from you again, but we are very sorry that Mr. Berg has not been well. He has our best wishes and kindest thoughts.</p>
	<p>There should be no difficulty in getting the books you mention from The Macmillan Co., 60 Fifth Ave., New York, as I understand they still have copies in stock. As the Company plans to issue the complete <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi> in one volume, the single volumes will bot be kept in print; but I think those you mention are available yet. Publication of the one-volume edition, as originally planned, has been delayed because of the paper shortage and manufacturing difficulties! There is paper only for sensational novels and such as may seem to promise big immediate sales.

Macmillans needed paper for one million copies of "Forever Amber"!</p>
	<p>In some ways ours is certainly a ludicrous and pathetic world just now!! I suggest that you write Macmillans saying that you had heard a rumor about the one-volume edition of <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi> and that you'd like to know when to expect it.
	<p>Things go well with us, and we are essentially happy and certainly grateful for innumerable good things - dear, good people like yourselves, for instance. It isa common error (and natural enough) to make <hi rend="underline">too</hi> much of this visible world. 
<hi rend="underline">Awareness</hi> of the <hi rend="underline">Other</hi> is so vitally necessary; and when one is aware, everything is touched with glory.</p> 
	<p>The University of Missouri will give me another doctorate at Commencement on June 5th. Mona &amp; I will be there.</p>
	<p>Even school &amp; college texts are all but impossible to get.</p>

                           <p>Love from Mona and me to you two.</p>
  
                                 <p>Your friend</p>
