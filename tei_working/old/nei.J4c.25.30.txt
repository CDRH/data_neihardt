<p>Dear Slade:</p>

	<p>I've just returned from roving in the West with Dr. Lucile and Dr. Bower Aly. We had a wonderful and profitable time looking up places where I've lived. I'll tell you when you arrive, and I'm <hi rend="underline">so happy</hi> you are actually coming on the 28th! Bless you! Affectionate thoughts for Nita too!</p>

					<p>Affectionately,</p>
