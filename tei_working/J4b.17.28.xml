Dear Ones:
<p>I have all your precious birthday letters as well, as the numerous gifts so vividly illustrated. Regarding the latter, I don't like to look into any mouth-horse's gift, but I really don't know what to do with so many green ties, and red socks. The hankerchiefs don't seem to be of very good quality, but I can use them in my workshop. Where <underline>was</underline> the fire, by the way?</p>
<p>You are all dollinks to write me such lovely letters. I really and truly know how lucky I am. You are all so fine, and what you say of me pertains more to your goodnes three to my merit.</p>
Endless love
Dad
