                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I have just finished reading one of your books, <hi rend="underline">A Cycle of the West</hi>, and I wanted to express my thanks to you for writing it. It has moved me deeply and brought beautiful strong pictures to my mind &#8212; like a child who has dabbled with water colors and is fianlly able to paint a house.</p>
                    
                <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the whole book, but my favorites were <hi rend="underline">The Song of the Indian Wars</hi> and <hi rend="underline">The Song of the Messiah</hi>. How lovingly you have captured with words the arduous struggle for life the Indians endured. While reading I became so involved with the mental and physical motion involved, I felt to be in the book, looking through the pages into the plains and the valleys, walking through the snow with them.</p> 
                
                <p>How fortunate you are to have participated in such a time and to be able to be able to tell so well of that time.</p>
                    
                <p>This <add>is</add> the first book of yours I have read and not the <unclear>last</unclear>. I love poetry and dabble in it myself from time <add>to time</add> &#8212; for me the words flowed and tumbled from one to <add>the</add> next, like a stream high in the mountain bouncing down over rocks. You make things so alive, so moving &#8212; the past does not seem like years ago in this book, but only a <unclear>long</unclear> yesterday away. When I came to the death of Crazy Horse I remembered the words and the sound of your voice when you recited it on the Dick Cavett Show. <note type="authorial">(over)</note> 
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.35b.30"/>
                
                <fw type="curatorial">30</fw>
                    
                    <unclear/> watched that show with a close friend and we were both moved to <unclear>tears</unclear> when you finished &#8212; and we hated to see the show end &#8212; we could have listeend to you all night.</p>
                    
                <p>I thought your rhyme scheme was magnificent in the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>. What a difficult thing to maintain and still hold the meaning together. I am usually not fond of rhymed poetry, because I feel people too often become convinced that the rhyme <hi rend="underline">is</hi> the poem, but your rhyming words were smooth transitions, stepping the words to the total statement or idea.</p> 
                
                <p>I suppose I could go on and on writing about how much I loved reading this book, but somehow I don't think I could get close to describing how I feel, how I've moved by it &#8212; I feel enriched to say the least.</p> 
                
                <p>I teach at the Adult High School here in Lincoln &#8212; English. I have put your books on a book list for my students &#8212; some of them didn't know who you were (I asked them the first night), but you can bet they will know plenty by the time class is over.</p> 
               
                <p>Again, thank you for writing the book and thank you for touching my life.</p> 
                <closer>
                    <salute>Sincerely,</salute>
