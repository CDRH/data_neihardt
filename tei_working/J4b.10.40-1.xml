March ? 
Darling Hilda: 
It was good to get your note. 
I have been down sick again. Yesterday I really did not care whether I lived or not. But today I notice I'm kicking hard once more! Sort of bronchial cold, and back and head ache all together. 
Dr. House thinks a "Bust" on a pedestal is a monument! Just think how ab-surd to remember America's greatest Poet that way! I wrote him how it shoudl be and I don't care whether they take it or leave it. But they can mess around with their men sculp tors and they'll have to take something as fine 

wonderful portrait they have in Omaha! - 
What scrambled eggs this world is! The 41
authorities give a society Lady the Pulitzer prize the year that John Neihardt <del/> comes out with his Collected Poems - and then they won't let me make Neihardt's Monument because I am a woman and an un-known quantity. but they'll pay a painter a big sum to paint a poor portrait. A thing is never considered good for what it is good for. It is used in the wrong place without any thought of its fitness 
I heard today by accident that in the Bermu-da islands they will not allow a single automobile. they insist on using homes altogether. You saw swim every day of the year at an average temperature of 76. The land is fertile black soil, they have water in plenty and no special "Pesto" - How about running over there some day? The language is English, it belongs to Great Britain. I wish the Neihardt family could wake up there tomorrow morning!
