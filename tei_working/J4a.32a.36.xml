Dear. Dr. Neihardt:
<p>The exellent article in the November 24th issure of the World Herald brought back memories of the English classes at Wayne High School.</p>
<p>Our English classes read with much interest the "Song of Hugh Glass" and our teacher, Miss Nellie Gingles, especially had every boy "experiencing" the role of Hugh Glass..This was in the early 1920's.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Wayne and my father, Anton Lerner, was a forty year employee(1885-1925) of the Weber Brothers Flour Mill. Father once told me about your "official" bell ringing duties at the Wayne Normal College.</p>
<p>Later, when attending Wayne State it was my pleasure to hear you speak to an assembly in the old administration building auditorium. It seems as but yesterday that I felt the warmth of the handclasp of "Little Bull". (Buffalo? M.M.Y-)</p> 
<p>May the every watchful Messiah grant you continued keeness of mind and physical stamina.</p>
Respectfully yours,
<signed>W A Lerner</signed>
Wilhelm A. Lerner
