Dear Enot, Ollie &amp; Nei:
<p>Back again, and with so much good to tell Nanny! I'm so glad I was able to be with you as much as I was. When I think of old Nei - and that's likely ot be any time - I tickle inside &amp; feel him bundled up against me!</p>
<p>Dog on it! By golly! He's the preciousest little cuss since you kids were babies, and I'm so glad he came! Nanny &amp; I talked &amp; talked about him last evening. Wait till Nanny sees him!</p>

There's no news, but we love you three,
Dad
<p>I wrote old Meek, and I'm sure he won't cast me out.</p>
