Mr. John G. Neihardt
Columbia, Missouri

Dear Mr. Neihardt,

<p>I remember with a great deal of pleasure the time you came to our college for a writer's workshop.</p>
<p>I do not know whether you are aware that Missouri Association of Teachers of English is working on a Literary Landmarks Project. We are trying to gain recognition for Missouri writers--those who were born here and those who are associated with the state by their residence of writings. Since Missouri Writers' Day is in October, we plan to publish a special edition of the MATE <underline>Bulletin</underline> which will include about fifty biographies. Of course your biography will be included. These will have to be brief--possibly 340 or 350 words. The data will include the writer's association with Missouri and his principal works. I'll included a mimeographed sheet which will give you an idea.</p>
<p>Will you send me what information you would like to have in your biography for this <underline>Bulletin</underline>?</p>
<p>I also think it would be very special if you would consent to write a short foreword or kind of salute to Missouri Writers for my introductory page.</p>
<p>We desire to place a bronze marker on houses where writers have lived. You former home at Branson will be included if we can obtain money for this phase of our project.</p>
<p>I realize we have a tremendous undertaking before us, but I am happy to have some very competent and enthusiastic people on my committee.</p>
<p>May I hear from you at your earliest convenience?</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Mareta Beatrice Williams</signed>
Mareta Beatrice Williams
Chairman, Literary Landmarks Committee of Missouri
