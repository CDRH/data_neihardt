Dear Poet Laureate
<p>May I share my fondest wishes for your personal thoughts in including me in the mailing list for your recording - "the wonder of it all."</p>
<p>When the record was recieved I left it for a Sunday morning hearing in my home - which is my church - and I have never spent a more lovely communion with my family.</p>
<p>Afterwards I gave it to your cousin, John Culler, and he enjoyed it in the reminder of the Sunday, March 14<underline>th</underline>, here in Belmont; a still unicorporated area under township government, sir.</p>
<p>I wish your recording could be in every secondary school in the county; and certainly in every library in the land...and world.</p>
<p>I cannot thank you enough for producing sounds and words that so well convey my own closest feeling for life; for the dear Indians; and for the tender expression of prayer eternal.</p>
<p>I am partial to Ogallala, Nebraska - least now I know all of Nebraska lies a favorite son who is truly a shining sun forever, most sincerely</p>
