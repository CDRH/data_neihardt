Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Thank you so much for your good letter. I know you had a good birthday. We saw you on television and thought you looked great.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I heard that you are going to be on Dick Cavett's show sometime in February. I hope you let us know when, or that it is published in the papers so that we can watch you.</p>
<p>It is great that BLACK ELK SPEAKS is such a run away seller. I think that is wonderful. Shows ther's hope for the young people. I think you can communicate with them.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Stan Smith the other day. He is deep in school and teaching.</p>
<p>I am teaching a Sunday School class, but I can't teach what is printed in the journals for the kids. They actually say that a person's salvation depends on how he treats the Jews--and that God will destroy wicked nations. Who is to say that a whole nation is wicked? It all depends on who's talking. I'm afraid I'm not a very good Christian, but I tell the kids that so they are not deceived. The minister when he visits the class seems to agree with me.</p>
<p>One of these days I will be seeing you again. Until then take care of yourself. All's well with us these days. Bill progresses well, and Alicia grows into a beautiful young lady.</p>
<p>The man in Grand Island shared Mrs. Young's letter to him about you and Willa Cather. We are putting it in our files. It is good to have the acquaintance of you and her clarified.</p>
With much love and affection from our household
