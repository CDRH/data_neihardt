                    <salute>Dear Doctor Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I sincerely hope, sir, this finds you and yours all in the very best of health. Also I hope all else is going along in fine shape for you.</p> 
                
                <p>Some time ago I watched, with complete fascination, your appearance on Dick Cavett's show. I don't honestly believe I've ever seen a more completely fascinating, interesting 90 minutes of <hi rend="caps">TV</hi>. Mr. Cavett said before the show that there had been, if I recall correctly, about three hours of conversation recorded with you. Had time been available I could have sat through the entire three hours and asked for more. It was great.</p> 
                
                <p>Are the rest of your books you and Mr. Cavett discussed available through The University of Nebraska Press? If they are I'd like to purchase copies and read them all.</p> 
                
                <p>Have you ever studied the other tribes throughout America. Various leaders I've read about are: Cochise, Mangus Colorado, Chief Joseph, Crazy Horse, Red Cloud among others. They were amazing, great men.</p>
                
                <p>Did you ever see the motion picture "Cheyenne Autmn."? If so, what did you think of it? Did you think it a fair portrayal of fact? The two leaders Dull Knife and Spotted Tail (I think it was) were very strong men. The conditions under which the Cheyennes were force<del>e</del><add>d</add> to make that march were horrible.</p> 
                
                <p>One thing I learned recently which came as quite a surprise is that President Andrew Jackson was such a swine toward the Indians. On an <hi rend="caps">NET</hi> program entitled "Trail of Tears" starring Johnny Cash as a Cheyenne leader portrayed Jackson as a real bigot. It surprised me quite a bit.</p> 
                
                <p>In the above mentioned movie one of the signs of leadership that the chief carried looked like a beaded package he always carried with him in his belt or in his robes. Why was such a packed looked on as a sign of

                    <unclear>l</unclear>eadership? Was it considered as having been given by the gods?</p> 
                
                <p>Sir I would be deeply flattered if you would allow me permission to write you again and possibly ask you some more questions. This is a subject I'm really interested in and could talk about for a long time.</p>
                
                <p>Before closing I have one final question. May I please have an 8 x 10 personally autographed photograph of you, sir? I would be an honor I'd never forget.</p>
                
                <p>That's all for now. Hoping to hear from you at your convenience I'll close for now. Wtih sincere best wishes and deep per sonal regards I remain,</p>
