Dear John,
<p>Bower and I are sorry not to be present for the celebration of your eightieth birthday, but we are with you in spirit at this gathering of your friends to wish you well.</p>

<p>As I have said before, my study of your life has impressed me with the richness of all your days. I cannot point to any one period and say, These were the Golden Years. They were and are all golden--the story years when you edited the Blade and wrote long letters to Bob Davis; the lyric yers when you sang as the wind; the Cycle years when heroes came to life again; the critic years when you reminded readers of the White Radiance; and now the teaching years. They are all you finest. your life is a rich stream, flowing its gold into the lives of your family, your colleagues, your students, your friends, your audiences. WE are all grateful for the privilege of knowing you.</p>

<p>On this your day, we join the hosts of your friends in wishing for you--and for us all--many more golden years for you.</p>
With our love,
Lucile and Bower
