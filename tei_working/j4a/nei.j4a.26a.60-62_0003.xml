                    <salute>Dear John:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Lucile and I have read your letter of April 30 again and again, and we are deeply gratified that you have been able to reconcile the event with your philosophy. As I know from sad experience, one's philosophy does not always serve in the time of tribulation.</p>
                
                <p>I write now to invite, not to <hi rend="underline">urge </hi>you to come to 211 Westmount for a visit as extended as you care to make it just as soon as we get back to Columbia. We<del><unclear>v</unclear></del>plan now to arrive on June 8. Apart from our understandable wish to have you as a guest, we have another consideration in mind. You and Lucile have quite a task to perfom. To get you into a book will not be easy. You are so incredible that some people find it difficu<del/><add>l</add>t to believe you in the flesh---beside<del>s</del> which printer's ink is pale stuff indeed. (I re<del>,</del><add>m</add>ember Elmer Ellis' true account of the astonished remark made by a distinguished scientist after he had heard one of your <del/> programs: "Why, he <hi rend="underline">really</hi> believes it!").</p>
                
                <p>If you are to be put into a book, you and Lucile will have a lot of talking to do. This coming summer will doubtless be ou<del>t</del><add>r</add> last period in Columbia--we may never be able to get back. Our house is now up for sale, with occupan<del>y</del><add>c</add>y offered Se<del>t</del><add>p</add>tember 1. I believe that the two of you should have every opportunity to talk freely, fully, lengthily, and conveniently. You could be quite comfotable<sic>comfortable</sic> in our guest room, which has all the conveniences including a bath; and you may count on Lucile to serve your favorite <del/> dishes. I think her book--and yours--will be a good, even perhaps a great one; and I think the book needs the kind of conversation that could take place if you were with us.</p>
                
                <p>To get the full import of my invitation, <del>t</del><add>y</add>ou should r<del>w</del><add>e</add>ad again the "Phaedrus"--particularly the section beginning at 275 <hi rend="underline">et seq</hi>., in which Plato has Socrates expound the superiority of the spoken over the written word. The book will have to be <hi rend="underline">written</hi>; but the writing can be ever so much better if good talk precedes the writing. See <hi rend="caps">S.H.</hi> Butcher's <hi rend="underline">Some Aspects of the Greek Genius</hi> (Macmillan: London, 1893), especially chapter on "The Written and the Spoken Word", p. 177 <hi rend="underline">et seq</hi>.    I hope you will plan to stay a while with us. If I may say so, I think you and Lucile owe it to the book of Neihardt.</p>

                <postscript>
                    <opener><hi rend="caps">P.S.</hi></opener> <p>We are grateful for the letter from your daughter, Hilda. Now we know as much as we need about the earthly side of the matter: the accident, the incredible error of the physician, the hopes and fears. As to the other side, the spiritual, we have no fears.</p>
