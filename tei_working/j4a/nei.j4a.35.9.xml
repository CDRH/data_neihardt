My dear Mr. Neiahrdt:
<p>First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to wish you most sincerely (and belatedly!) a happy, healthy and prosperous 90th birthday. These are my heartfelt wishes, fervently held, almost beyond the power of words to express.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am delighted--to put it mildly--at the thought of receiving your record on which you have recorded certain selections from your works. My younger brother, Steve, equally a longtime, enthusiastic reader of yours, will be just as happy to receive this record. Why? He has spent several days early in December 1970 reading and discussing several of your works with his students as he is a Reading-English specialist at a neighboring high school. The students were indeed receptive to your literary production and I am most certain they will be very happy to listen to the record...As you will note, I have gladly enclose a check for $5.75 to cover the cost of the record.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I extend an invitation to you to be an honored guest of mine if and ever you get to this neck of the woods. Might this be a possibility? I sincerely hope so. It gets pretty rough in these parts at this time of the year but the spring, summer and fall are simply beautiful.</p>
<p>Blessings on you, Mr. Neihardt. As you proceed with your future endeavors, you should know that you have both my deep appreciation and gratitude, for your entire literary production has served me and my entire family, as well, as a deep source of inspiration and enthusiasm. Godspeed for the months and years ahead.</p>
<p>With my kindest personal regards and reiterated admiration, I am</p>
Respectfully yours,
