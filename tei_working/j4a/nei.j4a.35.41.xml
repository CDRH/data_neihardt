Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Our department of Communication Arts is making a documentary motion picture of Wayne State College, principally special events of 1971. Learning that you will be here for commencement exercises on April 12, the photographer wishes to make a sound film of your poetry reading. There will be only one print and no commercial use will be made of it.</p>
<p>If this does not meet with your approval please advise me, and we shall certainly understand.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>W. A. Brandenburg</signed>
W. A. Brandenburg
