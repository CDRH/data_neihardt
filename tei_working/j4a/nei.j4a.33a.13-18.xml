<bold>MARRIAGE OF AN AUTHOR AND ARTIST</bold>
<bold>John W. Neihardt of Bancroft and Miss Mona Martinsen of New York Married.</bold>
<bold>Ceremony Performed in Omaha Sunday Afternoon by Rev. T. J. Mackay.</bold>
<p>Here is a partnership in art as well as a nuptial partnership: the wedding of John G. Neihardt of Bancroft and Miss Mona Martinsen of New York. He is a man of letters who, in the past three years, has been making a name for himself in the field of prose, fiction and verse. She is a sculptor well known in the east, but still better known abroad. In the spring of 1907 an important wrok of hers was exhibited in the Paris salon; it was a life figure called "The Maiden."</p>
<p>With Rev. T. J. Mackay officiating, the marriage ceremony was held Sunday afternoon at the apartments of Mr. and Mrs. Keene Abbott, 531 South Twenty-fifth avenue. It was an informal event with no guests present aside from the mother of Mr. Neihardt.</p>
<p>This is the initial visit of the bride to the west. Although she is young in her art she has already had wide recognition. It was of her, some two or three years ago, that F. Edwin Elwell, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said in an article puclished in the Arena Magazine, that he considered her the most gifted of the younger generation of women sculptors.</p>
<p>Words of such warm praise are, of course, to be considered an honor, but not to the same degree as is the bare fact that for five years she studied under Rodin, the pre-eminent master of France whose statue of Balzac is acknowledged by art critics to be one of the most striking pieces of modern sculpture.</p>
<p>As to Mr. Neihardt, his work in the eastern magazines began to attract wide attention some three years ago. His collection of short stories called "The onesome Trail," received many congratulatory reviews, both in America and in England, but his lyric sequence, "A Bundle of Myrrh." published a year ago, is the work which has done most to bring his name into prominence.</p>
<p>In an essay on Mr. Neihardt's book of poems, published in Putnam's Monthly last June, Gerald Stanley Lee has the following:
"***That first morning when the poems came I did not read them through. I was happy in the middle of the book, and in the middle of the idea that there could be such a book, not to go out doors on the meadow and think about it, think how there realiy was such a man, a latent, big conmporary, a possible classic, a man singing as if he were singing three hundred years ago or a thousand years on from today. After the first few pages I was too glad merely to take him as poetry. He was "news" and there was nothing to do but go out doors with him and look at mount Tom and the sky  and a man like this in it-not under a headstone visited by pilgrims and young ladies, or in a classical dictionary, but walking about this minute, in the town of Bancroft, Neb."</p>
<p>Since then Mr. Neihardt has been placing his verse with the leading periodicals. Last summer, for the Outing Magazine, he went down the Missouri river form the head waters to Sioux City in an open boat. His descriptive articles of that journey are to be a feature of that magazine during the coming year.</p>
<p>A representatice piece of prose fiction by Mr. Neihardt appeared over a year ago in "The Smart Set." The tale a novelette called "The Discarded Fetish," was a character study of uneusual strength, which earned much favorable comment from the reviewers, both in the cast and in the west.</p>

<bold>FIFTY MORE THAN OFFICIAL ESTIMATE
Death List of Marianna Mine Disaster Will Probably Reach One Hundred and Thirty-eight.
Work of Recovering Bodies Goes on Slowly Owing to Prevalence of Deadly Gases.</bold>
<p>Pittsburg, Pa., Nov. 29.-Twenty-five bodies, all but two horribly mutilated, and a number dismembered, were today taken from the mine of the Pittsburg-Buffalo Coal company at Marinna, forty miles south of here, where an exlosion occurred yesterday, killing many men and casting into gloom what was until then considered the model mining town of the world.</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the death list will reach at least 138 men. Officials of the company, who ast night stated that no over 125 had been killed, tonight admit that 138 men went down the shaft to work yesterday morning. According to miners and others familiar with the number of men generally employed in the mine, the death list will exceed the company's estimate by at least fifty.</p>
<p>It is possible that the exact number of men killed will never be known. Up to darkness tongiht twenty-five bodies had been brought to the surface in an iron bucket. Arms, legs or heads were missing from some and the trunks of others were burned, bruised and cut.</p>
<p>Two of the men had been suffocated and their bodies were not even scratched. On of these was John Ivoll, a cousin of John H. Jones, president of the Pittsburg-Buffalo Coal company, owners of the mine, who was employed as head timekeeper. Ivill's body was found beneath a coal digging machine and it was apparent that the young man had crawled there in a vain effort to escape the deadly fumes.</p>
<bold>His Head in Water.</bold>
<p>The body of the other man was found near Ivill. The unfortunate had placed his face in a pool of water, which all miners are advised to do when an explosion occurs, in a desperate attempt to fight off suffocation unti rescued. </p>
<p>This afternoon the coroner of Washington county held a meeting to organize a jury and then adjourned until all of the bodies have been taken from the mine.</p>
<p>Early today a small fire broke out in the mine. The blaze was extinguished before serious damage was done.
Reports have been in circulation all day that a second and more terrific explosion is likely to occur at any moment. The company officials assert this is not true. There is considerable gas in the mine, however. It is estimated that one-fourth of the victims are Americans. The work of rescue is being hurried on as rapidly as possible. At short intervals new men are sent into the mine to relieve others. Owing to the dangerous gases and mass of wreckage, the work is slow and is being carried on with great precaution. Experts form Pennsylvania and Wast Virginia are in charge and are being manterially assisted by J. W. Paul and Clarence Hall of the United States experimental and testing station <unclear>ocated</unclear> in Pittsburg. Notwithstanding the isolation of Marianna thousands of persons found their way there today. Tonight the undertakers are arranging for many funerals tomorrow.</p>
