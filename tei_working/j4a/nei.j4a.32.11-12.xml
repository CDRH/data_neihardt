(I <underline>think</underline> I'm not sure what day it is!)
Dear John,
<p>I'm at the coast and I've been working on the book all day and thinking about you so much I've decided to take a few moments to write you a letter. I'm nearing the end - really at last, and if if doesn't have a new Song to write about, this is the "music of what happens," so I guess if really does hace a Song - the truest of all. I will have to type all this. I work the way you did, first in long hand in <unclear/>, with deep consentration and a <unclear/> of singing inside. I can hear the ocean, and taught I <unclear>own</unclear> full of love for the world. Everyone should write your biography. Imagine a whole library</p>

full of biographies of you, and each one someone's own song made with your music as a tree! <unclear/> <unclear/> would ever be the same again - <unclear/> be taller and better and full of singing.
<p>There is something I want you to know about this book. I have not really thought much about its sale or its effect on my "career" - horrible word. (my career is people). I did this for itself. I did it for love - of you and your poetry - and prose - <unclear/> for the people who need you to be in the world to prove its all true, and <underline>possible.</underline> I will be glad if many people read it, but not for myself. Partly for <unclear/>.</p>
<p>The delays have been more agonizing for me then you know. I am like you in this way too - I don't talk about my troubles, but the last few years have been full of the kind of problems one can't escape sometimes. Bower and I have been in a sort of trial by fire - not with each other - but with family things that shake us to the core.</p>

<p>For my work, because this book is my <unclear/> work, it has been like your years in St. Louis, and I have wished more than once that I could tell you about it. But now that I'm on the point of finishing, I can look back and see that this was a pattern too. it was hard on you, and I'm sorry for that - but it's better book than it would have been if I hadn't had the struggle. I know the moments on the ridge too, and perhaps together we can help other people see that the aren't <unclear>insurmountable</unclear>.</p>
<p>Do I sound complaning? I'm not; I'm sitting under the flowering tree full of singing birds, may I call myself your official biographer now? I hesitated before because I wasn't sure I could earn the right.
One more thing. I want you to see the corrections in the whole manuscript. Rereading some of your letters I see that you may be a little worried about my</p>

<p>neglecting some of them, and I have never really replied to questions about it. You have read the manuscript in isolated sections, and sometimes you supported additions that appeared in other chapters. The whole book is a braid, and I don't want to repeat except for emphasis. When you read straight through I think you'll see what I <unclear/>. It's all these, but not every time. I will want to proof read the final manuscript after it is typed and if its possible to have Enid do it I would much perfer that she should. It may be a question of time, but in any case I'll have a copy for you to see before it goes to the press. </p>
<p>Do I have to stop writing to you when the book is out? I still have a lot to say about you in more books and in articles. I shall <unclear/> the academic world silly with all their <unclear/> nonsense and dissection of sick - sick myth theory. How would you like to launch a some school of critism?</p>
Love - can't you tell?
Lucile
