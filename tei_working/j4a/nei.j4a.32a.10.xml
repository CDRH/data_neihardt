Office of the Academic Dean
September 3, 1968
Dr. John G. Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska
Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I have been talking with my wonderful neighbors, the Hugh Munsons, and we think it would be a tremendous idea if you could arrange in your schedule to visit Pershing College for a convocation program for the student body, the faculty, and townspeople to either read some of your poetry or to talk briefly.</p>
<p>The time would be 1:30 p.m. on a Tuesday, and we would suggest the following possible dates: October 15, 22, November 5, 12, or 19.</p>
<p>We would need to know your required fee so that I could present this to the convocation committee for their approval.</p>
<p>I am sending to Hugh so that he may add a personal note and send it on to you.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>D. Eugene Meyer</signed>
D. Eugene Meyer
