Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>Professor Robert V. Hine of the University of California at Riverside and I are putting together a book of short interpretive essays backed up by selected readings which we call "The West: Readings on the American Frontier" to be published this winter by Little, Brown and Company. For our chapter dealing with violence and lawlessness on the frontier we should like to include chapter XXIV, "The Butchering at Wounded Kneee" from your book <underline>Black Elk Speaks</underline>. We made our initial request to your publisher, William Morrow and Company and were informed that all publication rights rest with you. We would be most grateful for permission to reprint that chapter under circumstnaces that you deem appropriate. We would of course acknoledge permission to use this material with a credit line in the proper place in our book.</p>
<p>I see Lucille Aly from time to time and recently learned that her biography of you is now in press. I look forward to reading it. I also recall with pleasure meeting and chatting with you in Mrs. Aly's home several years ago.</p>
<p>I hope this request will not inconvenience you unduly.</p>
<p>Every good wish to you.</p>
Sincerely yours,
Edwin R. Bingham
