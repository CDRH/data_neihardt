Dr. John G. Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska

Dear John: 
<p>It occurred to me that you might like to have a copy of the essay I have contributed to the <underline>festschrift</underline> just published in honor of my friend, the late C. M. Wise. Hence I send you a copy herewith.</p>
<p>Lucile is looking forward eagerly to participating in Neihardt day and to talking with you. I shall be with you in spirit, even though my obligations here preclude my being with you in person.</p>
Sincerely yours,

Bower Aly
