                411 West 115 Street
                New York City
                July 15th, 29
                
                Dear Mr. Neihardt, 
                
                I wroteyou yesterday in appreciation of your poems and letter. Today I am copying the following (though I think I have sent the lines to you) because of the St. Louis association, and becasue of the very remarkable testament the script is.
                
                I first heard of Mrs. Curran through Mr. Reedy, who had a great regard for her. This in 1917. There was no possible connection in her knowing anythign of me, and when I met her on April 30, 1925, <hi rend="underline">under absolute test conditions</hi>, (for she had no idea who I was) she gave me the following, <hi rend="underline">instantly</hi> on request. (To me this has been most arresting, that the poem came on May Eve, beause of my own ancestral connection with that great Feast of the Druids):
                
                To become an urn,
                To pour forth freely a stuff,
                The holy stuff which be lended to thy hand,
                Poured by that sacred Hand
                Which ne'er hath erred.
                To become quickened of this touch,
                Tranquil, yeah, as an amazed child
                Before Knowledge--not before wisdom,
                Which is the garment of Knowledge
                But before a CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE.
                To become quickened in thy in-man
                With an itch for surety,
                And be baffled by the thing
                Which confronts thee!
                This be nae fair fight, eh?
                Yet I say me,
                To become a crucible for such a potent stuff
                Is to become a Holy Vessel.
                And what then shall earth take up--
                The Holy Vessel, and consume?
                Or shall it for to break it?
                I say me, it shall be drunk,
                And drunk thirstily.
                
                As I was leaving, Mrs. <hi rend="caps">C.</hi> said, "Patience has something more for you. But one greater than she is speaking through her."
                
                Behold I dip mine sword within a holy red,
                And its tip is flamed,
                And I have placed it within thine hand.
                
                
                There was no talk of my work nore of my experiences during our conversation. Mrs. C. had absolutely no knowledge of me. If you ever wish to use the above separately --as a substantiation of Mrs. C. if she ever needs it--please feel free to do so. But not in connection with your own estimate: I want that strong and clear interpretation mexed with no thought but your own.
