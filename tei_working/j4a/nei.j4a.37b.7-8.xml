                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>The one disappointment of my summer in Nebraska was that I did not get to shake your hand and tell you of my admiration and love for you and your literary works. I saw you come into Bancroft Friday while I was at the Center; I am the woman in the brown pants suit who watched the filming you did on Saturday; I also enjoyed seeing and listening to you on Sunday. I could have reached out and touched you several times, but could just not bring myself to tire you further. When I spoke to my brother about my disappointment in not being able to speak to you, he suggested that I write to you.</p>
                
                <p>When visiting in Bancroft with my family three years ago, I learned of the Neihardt Center; I recalled studying "The Song of Hugh Glass" in Rosalie High School; when I returned to Baton Rouge, I was delighted with your program on the Dick Cavett <hi rend="caps">T.V.</hi> show. Your instant recall is amazing.</p> 
                
                <p>While attending Wayne State College this summer for graduate work in English, I met many of your former students; all had one comment in common--you had taught them to love poetry.</p>
                
                <p>I bought every book, record, etc. I could put my hands on while in Nebraska and am now reading them to my heart's content.</p>
                
                <p>Dr. Neihardt, I would like to include about a month in English II intersting my students in your beautiful works. I shall be teaching four classes of English II and Latin I, II, and III. I shall not be teaching German this year.</p>
                
                <p>I am probably asking the impossible, but would you suggest some of your works I could best use; how can I go about transferring my love in your work to my students? I thought, besides studying some of your works, the students might enjoy making a miniature duplicate of the Sioux Prayer Garden.</p>

                <fw type="curatorial">8</fw>
                
                <p>Dr. Neihardt, I have always enjoyed listening to older people. Even before the age of ten, I realized that in my grandmother's conversation with me was a great deal of wisdom about living. Now that I am fifty-seven, I appreciate it doubly; I find that same wisdom of life in your conversation and in your literature. I am sure that I shall find more as I continue reading your things.</p>
                
                <p>Do take good care of yourself. Thank you for all the happiness you have given me.</p> 
                <closer>
                    <salute>Sincerely,</salute>
