I remember your first poem "Divine Enchantment" and how proud my partner was when you sent him a copy!! A.P.N.

Skokie 6, Illinois
<p>Dear John: Your note concerning your vivid dream of Fred was so interesting and such experiences are difficult of explanations.<p/>
<p>I am sending you a clipping from last Sundays "Letters to Editor" from our Chicago Tribune, you may have seen it but it was along your line-and maybe <underline>you</underline> can understand it all-(I'm frank to say <underline>I</underline> cannot). To you work so hard on your poems? So sorry I missed <unclear>session</unclear> of your birthday celebration and <underline>how</underline> old are you? Fred was 2 years older than I and shall be 75 my next birthday.  I <underline>think</underline> I read everything in Chigo Tribune, but <underline>that</underline> I missed. My daughter in law was in Arkansas and I was looking after family. So May have been careless at that time.</p>
<p>May I wish for Mrs. Neihardt and you a comfortable 1961 and wish sincere regards to you both, I am</p>
Sincerely, <unclear>Helena Pale</unclear> Newton
