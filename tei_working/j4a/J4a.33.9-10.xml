Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I have been inspired by reading the digest of your lecture on creatice writing. I only wish we could have more such masterpieces of literature.</p>
<p>And your educational hour on T.V. withMr. Ron Hull most surely brought the flowering of poetry again to the cultural plains of your great State and its neighbors. I can sense the lyric fragrance from here. Surely, the spirit of the world is the better for your leavening.</p>
<p>It was my humble pleasure to read my 14th annual poem to my Colorado Legislature when I was in Denver last month. It seems that all men are thirsting for the "infinite sweetness."</p>
<p>It is my prayer that good health and inspiraiton may long continue your life of "revelation and dedication."</p>
Sincerely yours,
<signed>Milford E Shields</signed>

Dear Dr. Shields,
<p>You are a dear, generous-hearted man to write me as you do, and I can assure you that your kindness makes me happy.</p>
<p>I note what you say about reading your fourteenth annual poem to the Colorado Legislature, and I do wish you would send me a copy of that poem.</p>
<p>I have been having a happy time this winter working on my so-called autobiography--so called because I do not know what else to call it! The title is "The Old Man Remembers." I have thirty-seven thousand words written and I should be trhough with the task during this year.</p>
<p>Be sure that I think of you with a warm heart.</p>
Your friend,
John G. Neihardt
