Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>We have received A BUNDLE OF MYRR and appreciate so much your special effort with it. I am going to have to handsomely rebound in the near future. The DIVINE ENCHANTMENT is being slip-cased and when the slip-case is done, I shall try to send you a colored photograph of it.</p>
<p>Under separate cover, I am sending you the Dutch edition of BLACK ELK SPEAKS. This is the first of the foregin translations that I have been able to land and shall look forward to finding others. It was exciting to receive it.</p>
<p>Kindest personal regards.</p>
Sincerely yours,
