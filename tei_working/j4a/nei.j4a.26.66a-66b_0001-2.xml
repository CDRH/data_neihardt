                    <salute>Dear John:-</salute></opener> <p>It was good to learn that you can be with us again to bring the beauty of your song and the inimitable quality of your spirit. For it is by these things that the soul is nourished.</p>
                    
                <p>Now for a few details concerning the arrangements. Thompson wants you to speak to his large class on Tuesday May 20th. You should therefore arrive Monday May 19th, and thus have time to rest. And you must not hurry away. Saturday will be plenty of time for you to leave. You could, by <unclear>starting</unclear> then, reach home Sunday and be ready for classes Monday. The weather should be <unclear>glorious</unclear> then, and the land touched with the freshness of spring, yet in the full tide of growth. Besides, when I was in Washington recently, I managed to get some <unclear>eight</unclear>-year old Bourbon. And such requires time for consumption. I am saving every drop until your arrival.</p>
                
                <p>We are emerging from the worst winter that I <unclear>can remember</unclear> in this place. We have had colder weather, but I do not recall that we

                    ever had so much snow or such blinding blizzards. And I ought to add, such pure white beauty. With the earth covered, and the trees and shrubs laden, the effect was <unclear>glorious</unclear>. "Skool to the Northland, Skool!"</p>
                
                <p>The other day, or rather night, a call from Champaign Ill. told us that we are grandparents of a baby daughter, born to our <unclear/> daughter, Alice Jean. We are, of course, still rejoicing, and expect to continue in that state.</p>
                
                <p>And then the <unclear/> day came news not so good. It <add>was that</add> my brother had fallen on the ice and fractured a leg. He is in the Boone County Hospital. I understand though that he is getting on well. I hope I can telephone him tonight &#8212; the hospital <unclear>surely</unclear> will have an <unclear>extension phone</unclear>.</p>
                
                <p>Have you ever read Bernard Diaz's story on the conquest of Mexico? He was one of Cortez's soldiers. He wrote this account in his old age. And, though not a professional writer, what a wonderful story he tells, and with many a quaint little mannerism or turn of expression. His honesty, too, <unclear>shines</unclear> in his his words.</p>
