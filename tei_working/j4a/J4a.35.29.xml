Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>A clipping from y sister, who lives up in Randolph, brings news of your having celebrated your 90th birthday on January 8th. Belatedly, I send you joy and felicitation on the occasion and on all the acievement it represents. Form the point of view of a callow 67, ninety years is in itself a notable attainment. But to have compounded the time with so much accomplished, and so notably, as you have done, is indeed cause for warmest congratulations.</p>
<p>I hope your writing on your autobiography proceeds steadily and rewardingly. Autobiography is, to myself, the most pleasurable as well as instructive sort of reading. Count me among those who eagerly wait for yours to be published.</p>
<p>It was a satisfaction to find Loren Eiseley quoting four lines of yours to open his most recent book, THE INVISIBLE PYRAMID. He was, at one time, working with L. C. Wimberly on the starr of the PRAIRIE SCHOONER, the University's literary magazine; and though now a distinguished anthropologist, writes still as a poet.</p>
<p>Pribilege as it is to have a word from you, as in the past, I would not wish this note to divert you from the task you have in hand. Let me be content simply to wish you joy and strength and good prospects for your 91st year and those that may follow.</p>
Sincerely yours,
<signed>John L. Casteel</signed>
