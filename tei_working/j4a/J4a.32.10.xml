Dear John,
<p>I appreciated your letter, and from your comments I can tell you're having a good time with the writing. I'm so glad you can be in Nebraska- it is fitting, really isn't it? and I look forward to the book.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I go to the <unclear/> to finish the last section of the biography. I've been working on it, but I had to get away from the telephone and the doorbell. </p>
<p>Bower will do the hospital going for a few days, and I should be able to wind up. I'm doing a short chapter on the whole <underline>Cycle</underline> - its steps up in spiritual level and its total meaning, and if you have a minute I would like one thing for the final chapter! What do <underline>you</underline> think are the outstanding events of the last six years for you? Could you make me a short list? I know you're busy yourself, and if it's an <unclear/> don't trouble</p>
<p>with it. I have more of your perspective on earlier years - you're doing so many things it's hard to sort out the most vital. Anyway, what matters most to <underline>you</underline> is important.</p>
<p>I like your life, John. It says something aside from your work; actually is says the same thing your work says, but in a different way. The Chicago period says a mouthful!</p>
<p>I'll write you as soon as I get back from the ocean.</p>
Love,
Lucile
