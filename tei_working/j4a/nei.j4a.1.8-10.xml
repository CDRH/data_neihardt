<salute>My dear Neihardt:</salute>

<p>If you could live an hour of my life you would then know what a terrible thing it is to die. I suppose I get more real enjoyment out of things, every twenty-four hours than you <unclear/> <unclear>twenty</unclear>-four days. The one obstruction to unbridled mental peace is a note of earnestness. The moment anything strikes you as really important or serious, that moment multiplied by ten becomes a task.</p>

<p>I am a sort of socialist in my own way. But it depends upon a good many external things, and I have no regular internal policy. I find it much more satisfactory to be affected by every wind that blows. I am an anarchist in the morning, a socialist at noon, a free-thinker at sunset, and a penitent at midnight &#8212; but you can bet I get my sleep between that and the dawning so that the next day looks just as fresh.</p>

<p>The only way they could have put Shelley on the blink was to have called him Mr. Shelley, although the effort to annhilate Shakespear<sic>Shakespeare</sic> by prefixing the given name "Bill" was a failure. Keates might just as well have been a baseball pitcher. I believe he did throw some pretty good curves in his time.</p>

<p>While we are on the subject of mutual confidences, I suppose I can say to you that life to me is more or less of a union job anyhow. I will stay with any combination that gives me high wages and good results. Don't you get the pin-headed idea, out there on the flat lands, with the wire grass tripping you up, that I am a"city-ridden" wretch. I can fall backwards into any chair or down into a bunch of palms that are just about as broad and fascinating as any in a tropical garden, and I can get any perfume that was ever wafted across the noses by simply sitting down and thinking hard of a thousand places I have been and am going to again.</p>

<p>I do not believe in mirages, dreams, real-estate maps or railroad guides. You've got to show it to me. I want to be lead to it.</p>

<p>I am glad that your family had a "hell of a fight" to get into the open air. Mine had a "hell of a fight" to get back from it. I was crawling around in the bunch grass of Nebraska when your parents were figuring out whether they would rather have a boy or a girl.</p>

<p>I guess that the best way for both of us is to proceed along the particular route that seems less wearying to our moral feet. I am sure we shall both bring up in the same place, no matter whether the road be long or short. The only difference is this: one of us will steal axle-grease for the trips the other will borrow it &#8212; (but in either case the fellow who lends it is likely to be dead when the debt is paid.)</p>

<p>I am glad to know that there is a prospect of seeing you someday in New York. I enclose a portrait of myself on

a yacht. You will see that I am not nearly so old a party as you conceived me to be. If you have any difficulty locating me, let me say that I am the gentleman with the black coat. The other party is not me. I am having a similar picture taken in a blue coat, which I will send later &#8212; a profile.</p>
