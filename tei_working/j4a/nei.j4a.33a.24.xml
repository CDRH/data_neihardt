Mr. John G. Neihardt
Lincoln, Nebraska

Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>On behalf of the Missouri Association of Teachers of English, I want to express my deep appreciation to you for writing the introduction to our special <underline>Bulletin</underline> of Missouri Writers.</p>
<p>I shall send you a copy as soon as it is published. I hope to have it done for our meeting in St. Louis when the State Teachers Association meets on November 6 and 7. However, it will all depend on the printer, and we may have to wait until a later date.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope you are recovering satisfactorily from your eye surgery.</p>
Sincerely, 
<signed>Mareta B. Williams</signed>
