                    <salute>Dear John: -</salute></opener> <p>I have at hand your letter in early December, and that of the 28 Dec. says that you are mailing me a copy of that record of the Song of the Three Friends. But since the record has not yet come, I thought I had better tell you. Maybe the postoffice can trace it if lost</p>
                
                <p>Both letters are fine, so full of the spirit of you, <hi rend="underline">that inner ever-burning</hi> flame. They gave me, as your letters always do, a lift.</p>
                
                <p>I was so glad to hear that the television continues to go well, and that Orgeon has invited you for a celebration. I hope your plane will fly at a time of day in which you can see the "shining mountains". My, what a trip that will be. I love that land which is so far west as to be at the very doorway of the East.</p>
                
                <p>We went to Champaign Ill. at Christmas to see our little granddaughter &#8212; and of course the daughter &amp; son-in-law, too. What a nice visit we had! they were all so glad to see us. At Thanksgiving we made the same kind of a visit to the other daughter's family near Harrisburg, Pa. to see the little grandson. One day there <del>while</del> we returned from an automobile ride. A cool rain was falling. The little fellow was asleep. I carried him and I forgot to protect his face So the mean icy drops hit it. And you know he didn't cry!

                    I thought that a good indication of his disposition.</p>
                
                <p>Sanford Gray's address, the one you gave me, is &#8212; <unclear>here</unclear> I see that my secretary typed it. It is enclosed.  You see, I assume that you may have lost it. If not, why not write to <hi rend="underline">Orpheus Records</hi>. More of your readings, preferably with <del>explanation, sh</del> <unclear>comments</unclear>, should be available. I can see four right now, Crazy Horse, Sitting Bull <add>and two of</add> your lyrics, one <add>of</add> the love lyrics, the other of the lyrics you gave here. Recorded <unclear>&#8212;</unclear> all of them <unclear>&#8212;</unclear> as you spoke them here would be wonderful.</p>
                
                <p>Does the University have any facilities for doing this? If so, and you think a letter from me to the president would help, I'll gladly write one. I really feel that putting you on records in permanent form is a must. Your voice and something of your personality would live always.</p>
                
                <p>Those white flakes have been coming down all day. The earth is covered, and every bush is loaded. The dark limbs and even the tiny twigs atop the <unclear>spare</unclear> design of the <del/> trees are coated. In the distance, objects dim, blur, and finally disappear into the gray. We are for the time living in an enclosed world. And now dear friend, so often in my thoughts and always in my heart, may life be good to you,</p>
