THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA AT SPRINGFIELD

Dr. John G. Neihardt
5835 Vine Street 
Lincoln, Nebraska 68505 
Dear Dr. Neihardt, 
Last fall when we contacted you about an appearance before our student body, you indicated through Mrs. Young that you might be up to it in the spring. Well, spring is nearly here, so we thought we would check with you ont he possibility of you paying us a visit and reading some of your work to our students; however, we do not want you to do so at the expense of your health. 
USD/Springfield is about 230 miles from Lincoln, so travel arrangements should not be too difficult to work out. In fact, we could provide the transportation from Lincoln to Springfield and back again via college auto. 
Late March or early April, or any time convenient for you would be suitable for a convocation date. Also, if you would consent to honor us with a visit, please indicate what type of honorarium (fee and expenses) you would need. 
Thank you for your consideration. Regardless of the decision, it has been a joy to  correspond with you and Mrs. Young, and we wish you Godspeed and good health. 
Sincerely,
Milton Holtz 
Milton E. Holtz, Chm.

P.S. My home originally was near Beemer, Nebraska, and I still take the local paper. The Bancroft Blade is a part of the paper (several local papers have been con-solidated into one), so I have been able to   follow with great interest the restoration of your study in Bancroft, Nebraska.
