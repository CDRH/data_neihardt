Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I'm sorry I wasn't able to attend this year's Neihardt Day, but hope you can use another clipping from the <underline>World Herald</underline>. I have made a photocopy for my file on one John G. Neihardt.</p>
<p>The Upper Missouri River raft trippers had a nice reunion last week on the occasion of a visit from one of the Fort Benton Cruise Company members. We picknicked at DeSoto Bend Wildlife Refuge and saw the <underline>Bertrand</underline> steamboat. What an exciting find this is!</p>
<p>With best wishes to the Youngs, and I'll be payign you all a call someday.</p>
Sincerely,
Mildred Goosman
