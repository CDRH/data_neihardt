Mr. John G. Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska 68505
Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>You will find enclosed a request I have made of the University of Missouri Library and Donald D. Dickinson's reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickinson and I had met previously and keep in touch periodically on other matters. When I learned of the limited Limited Edition of A BUNDLE OF MYRR, I knew I could not hope to get a copy - so I approached the Library for a xerox of it for my collection, which would eventually end up in the Syracuse University Library.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickinson quite properly seeks your permission to have this done, and I hope you will give it to him. I am determined to have this Eastern outpost a great Neihardt center and appreciate the generous time and attention which you are giving my interests in this regard.</p>
<p>Would you please write Mr. Dickinson?</p>
Kindest regards.
Sincerely yours,
<signed>Frank Piskor</signed>
