Dear John,
<p>We are held up by car trouble and didn't get home till later than we hoped--a hawk flew into the headlights and pulled loose the connections, and we developed a vapour lock in the old car going through the mountains. But we finally made it. I called Hilda from Kansas City, and I have just written to Ollie, so they will get the manuscript as soon as I can get it off.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see you, and we got quite a bit done. There is never time enough, but we talked about the questions we needed to take up. I will be working mornings in the library carrel where there is, praise the Lord, <underline>no telephone</underline>. Everything should move quickly now, and I will get the final chapter to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>How was the convention in Salt Lake? I hope the trip was not too warm; the desert can be pretty devastating. You must tell me about the exhibits; did you show the jade? If so, I want to know what people said about it. It is beautiful--the stones and the work.</p>
<p>The copies of <underline>Present-Day American Literature</underline> articles arrived, and I am most grateful. I should have a bill, however. I will write to Florence, because I want to bear the costs unless you have an arrangement for free copies.</p>
<p>Bower sends his regards and a pat for Jacques; he is busy on a book and a houseful of grandchildren and dogs. Stewart is here with his fiancee, who is a delightful girl, and Charley's wife, Mina is here too. They are all running things for me so I can work, and they all send love to you. So do I--much love. I am not entirely happy to be finishing this book; I would be really unhappy if I didn't have plans for others about you. I've become a critic with a message.</p>
Love,
<signed>Lucile</signed>
P.S. I'm enclosing the pictures of Muskie and ALys. Tell Myrtle I'll write soon.
