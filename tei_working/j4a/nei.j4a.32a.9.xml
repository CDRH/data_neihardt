Dear Doc,
<p>It warmed my heart again to receive your letter and to know that you enjoyed the program and my reports of it in both story and column.</p>
<p>As you well know you are someone very special in my heart and I might add, since you met her, also Marilyn's.</p>
<p>I am living in Lincoln and you can reach me through Marilyn's office at 432-3383 at any time.</p>
<p>We would like to have dinner with you some night so that you can hear yourself in one of your finest hours. We taped the highlights of the program at Bancroft and you might just be in-terested in hearing it again in case you have forgotten the magic moments of that day.</p>
<p>I am also enclosing some photographys of those moments.</p>
<p>Would you let me know what day or evening would be convenient. We could have you over for dinner, we could go out for dinner, or pick a picturesque evening when we can picnic on the shore of a nearby lake that we know where you could add another beautiful sunset to your memories.</p>
With affectionate regards, I am
Sincerely,
<signed>Tom</signed>
