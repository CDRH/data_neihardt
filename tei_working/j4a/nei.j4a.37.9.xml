Dear Dr. Neihardt and the Youngs:
Thank you so much for your letter. I am so sorry about the death of Dr. Neihardt's son. I'm sure that he looks on it as the great and glorious change that he anticipates for himself. I have been reading a book, THE WORLD BEYOND which tells some of the things that Dr. Neihardt has spoken of, and it all fits in. I am glad for his faith and courage. It helps the rest of us very much. 
We did enjoy Dr. Neihardt's Christmas card and Alicia took it for her treasures. 
Please forgive my wretched typing. This is Alicia's typewriter and mine is at the repair shops. I am not used to this one and make all sorts of extra errors. 
I am sure the work on the book takes all the good doctor's energy. I hope he can get another volume finished before too long. So you're up to 1908--a year before I was born--and there are so many stories to tell, I know. I hope he can feel well enough to finish them all. What a treasure.
I saw Black Elk Speaks and When the Tree Flowered in a book store last time I was in Omaha. They looked good and I hope are selling well. 
Thank you for the folders on ALL IS BUT A BEGINNING. It is such a lovely book. I wish everyone could read it. We sold quite a few at Christmas time at the Memorial
Bill's and Jan's baby is due any time now. I am flying out to Kimball to drive back with her on Sunday. She wants to have her Omaha doctor deliver her. She shoiudl be due about the last of January. Bill is trying private practice in Kimball to see how he likes it. 
I know Dr. Neihardt will hate to spend time away from his book, but that's what he gets for being famous. My love to all of you including Jacques.
Mildred
