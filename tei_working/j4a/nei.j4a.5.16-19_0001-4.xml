                <p>I was glad to hear yesterday that you are back at your task after your wanderings. Your visit to <del/> us <add>was</add> a delight and I sincerely hope it may not be long before you come this way again. I heard Mrs. Howard remark, soon after you left, that she 
                
                    <pb facs="nei.j4a.5.16-19_0002"/>
                
                considered your visit a great success, and that you were one of the easiest and most delightful guests she had ever entertained; so you need not worry about being "difficult". As for me it was no end stimulating and worth-while to have even those few hours with you. There are only two things I regret about your stay &#8212; 1st that it wasn't longer, so that I might see more

                of you all alone by ourselves; and 2nd that somehow I didn't get an opportunity to introduce you to an editor or two, so that there would be a better and more immediate chance of your coming back soon, to stay. I don't know any better place than Carmel for you &#8212; and I hope you will take it under serious consideration. You left two copies of the Return of Odysseus; one of them you told me to keep (for which

                many thanks) and one I was to send to someone; who was in? I can't remember. We had Masefield in San Francisco last week, a quiet shy person, who seems to have been through hell &#8212; so subdued, so depressed; but a poet and a lovely spirit. I'd like to know him better. My work is going on + I'm pulling through one of the hardest parts yet. Don't let anything interrupt your Three Friends. It's supreme. I was intensely interested in Curly. Good guy. He knows a real one when he sees him. I wrote <unclear>Crowminshield</unclear> some days ago to find out about Mrs. Custer. Haven't heard from him yet; too soon.</p>
