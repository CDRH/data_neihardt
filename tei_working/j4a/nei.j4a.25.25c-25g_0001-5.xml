                    <salute>Dear John:</salute></opener> <p>Your nice reply to my letter to you was indeed pleasing to me. My father was always so proud of you and I recall you sent him an autographed copy of your first poem signed "To my benefactor" and he was so pleased. When I realize, John, that he was only 51 years old when he died and, that, during that time he influenced so many young people, I marvel at him. (I am <hi rend="underline">71</hi>, so I feel that he was young when he died.) Mother did so much to help him and was, herself, a very capable woman.

Fred, Jim and I had to have a great deal of responsibility, compared to present day children of 11 and 12. At 12 I had to learn how to put in new electrical fuses as Electricity was a mystery to father and he would take me to a boys dormitory if lightning had put out lights &#8212; lift me onto to a table and I'd put in a new fuse. <unclear>We</unclear> had to take temperatures of ill students and if they had fever, he had a doctor, otherwise would advise simple remedies.
