Dear Mr. Neihardt:
Under separate cover I am sending you copier of all of the correspondence in our archives from you to George Seymour. I hope to enjoy this chance to slip back in time and look over your own shoulder. 
Our archivist has notified the University of Missouri of the availability of copies of this material as you suggested. 
And I want to thank you for the newspaper clippings you sent from the Lincoln paper. My wife is from Lincoln (I am Grand Island) and we go there every year to visit. 
Very best wishes to you. 
Cordially,
Douglas Wilson
