*******POSSIBLE WORDS ON SIDE OF PAPER,  HOWEVER TOO <unclear/> TO READ*********** 
Mr. John G. Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska 68505

Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>Your letter of the 17th is exciting indeed. I look forward to the copy of A BUNDLE OF MYRRH from the University of Missouri. It would be wonderful if you could enrich our collection here with a bequest of a copy of DIVINE ENCHANTMENT. I shall be eternally grateful and so will the University.</p>
<p>We are trying a selected list list of booksellers in an aggressive attempt to fill some of the major gaps in my collection, and I shall advise you of results.</p>
<p>Do you plan to be at the Lincoln, Nebraska address throughout the winter?</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
Sincerely yours,
<signed>Frank P Piskor</signed>
