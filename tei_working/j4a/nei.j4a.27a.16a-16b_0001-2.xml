                    <salute>Dear Mr Neihardt.</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Bancroft is celebrating it's<sic>its</sic> 75th anniversary <del>i</del><add>o</add>n June 20 and 21 of this year.</p>
                
                <p>I am writing a pageant to be given on the evening of the 20th. The most important events in the history of the town will be the theme. Since your living here was one of these important events, I would like to have your permission to quote from some of your poems, written while you were a Bancrofter.</p>
                
                <p>I am planning a scene showing you and your mother arriving in town. Then show some Indians telling you stories of their people, and then the quotes and a portrayal of one of the Indian legends.</p>
                
                <p>Could you tell me the name or names of any <del>k</del><add>o</add>f the Indians who were helpful to you in your research? And also, if I am not asking too much, your favorite Indian legend?</p>
                
                <p>It would be such a satisfaction to me, and I am sure, a great pleasure to the audience, to know that this bit of town history was right from the source--so to speak.</p>
                
                <p>You are the most famous person who has ever lived in our little town. So I want the scenes in the pageant which have to do with your life here and your poetry, to impress the audience, to give a moment of beauty, and leave a lasting impression of your wonderful writings.</p>
                
                <p>I am afriad the town would not look familiar to you if you were to see it now. Not that it has changed much. It has only grown older. Like all of us who lived here when you did. A few ne<del/><add>w</add> buildings to take the place of old ones burned. Some new houses, and lots of new names and faces. There is no longer a Bancroft Blade. That poor little paper led a stormy life after the death of Editor Cates. It was finally absorbed by The Wisner Chr<del>i</del><add>o</add>nicle and is now just an inside page in that publication.</p>
                
                <p>I edited a paper here for a year after the Blades<sic>Blade's</sic> demise. A former student of yours ( I have forgotten his name) c ame to my office one day and told me it was the ambition of his life to own and edit the Bancroft Blade because he admired you so much and knew that you had once been Editor of that weekly. There was no Bancroft Blade to buy, so he went on his wa<del>s</del><add>y</add>, a vastly dissapointed young man.</p>

                <p>I have taken up enough of your time with my chatter. I hope that you will be kind enough to furnish me with the information I need and to allow m<del>w</del><add>e</add> to quote a few lines of your poetry.</p>
                
                <p>Thanking you on behalf of all Bancrofters Past and Present.</p>
