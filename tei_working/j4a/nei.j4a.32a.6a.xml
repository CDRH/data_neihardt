Dear Gaki:
<p>We are still basking in the enjoyment of your visit. I have had dozens of very favorable comments and you won the hearts of my people and all those who met you. I gave copies of Black Elks Prayer to the Knocke's who took us to Rock Creek Station and to some others who helped us. (such as the Nuckalls)</p>
<p>I know the people eageraly await the enjoyment of reading your books. The Nuckalls have offered to sell the remaining books at their Newspaper office and ran a 2 column add (free) concerning them. They are the people that took you to the motel and who wrote the fine articles about you. Another picture of you and the children came out in this<crossed>m</crossed> mornings paper, and I am sending it to you and the youngs. I shall read the letter of thanks that you and the Youngs wrote to us to the congregation this Sunday morning. </p>
<p>I am also writing to Hilda this morning. We hope to visit Columbia the last of this month.</p>
<p>I don't know when we will be in Lincoln--probably within a week. We will drop by to say "Hi." Our regards to you and your adopted grandparentws--the Youngs. </p>
<p>Thanks again for your wonderful visit, address, and for your friendship.</p>
With love and affection,
