                    <salute>Dear John,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>The book arrived, and it's beautiful! You were dear, like always, to autograph and send a copy for us. I've always been proud to know you, but I'm prouder than ever. Your memories are beautiful and moving, and I'm glad you are writing them. I suspect I know your past as well as anyone besides yourself, and though my pictures are all second hand I probably wish more fully than anyone that you could remember and record <hi rend="underline">everything</hi>. Everything about your life is good and good to know.</p>
                
                <p>I say the last thing for a very good reason &#8212; Bower and I have just been combing my retyped manuscript of the Biography before it goes back to the press. It's really the first time Bower has read it all straight through, and he said at the end of our "proofing" to tell you it's a wonderful book &#8212; about a wonderful man! I hope it's a good book, but I can certainly agree it's about a wonderful man.</p>
                
                <p>I wish I could see you. It seens so far to Nebraska, and I think about you so much of the time it's strange not to be able to talk to you face to face. Perhaps I can again sometime &#8212; <unclear>will</unclear> hope. I'm going to enjoy editing your letters. I <unclear>done some</unclear> work already, and I <unclear>can</unclear> see at the outset that the trouble is going to be <unclear>selecting</unclear>. They're all <unclear>special</unclear>.</p>
                
                <p>Stuart sends special love to you and you have a little honorary great-grandson who would delight his Gaki. He's an energetic Wub, as you must have been &#8212; he has the fastest grab in the West. Stuart is off to Tailand<sic>Thailand</sic> next week, and Susan and little Charley will be in Eugene. Stuart says to tell you we all ought to drive across the country again. He could have a beer with you now.</p> 
                
                <p>I'll write you again very soon, and I shall write Myrtle too. Love from us all, and bless you for the <hi rend="underline">lovely</hi> book.</p>
