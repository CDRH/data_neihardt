                    <salute>Dear Dr. + Mrs. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I am indeed a poor correspondent, but the past month has been a very active one for us. I had intended to write you as soon as we returned from our trip to Columbia, but I was swamped with final examinations that needed to be graded and report cards. As soon as school was out we went to Alna, Oklahoma for a week's visit with some of Willa's relatives. On our return, I started immediately on the camp for retarded children.</p>
                
                <p>The camp has really been consuming my time, but I am enjoying the work. I had a schedule all planned, but by the end of the first hour of the first day I saw that

                    we would never accomplish all that we planned in a day's time. They do things so much slower than normal children. It is interesting to observe how some of them are normal in some fields and way below normal in others. One disadvantage to being director is that I cannot work with the children at all times. I have always despised paper work and there is some connected with this job, there are some mistakes being made, but these will be ironed out in future years. The children seem to be enjoying themselves and, after all, that is all that is really important.</p>
                
                <p>One of the reasons <add>why</add> I intended to write earlier was to find out how Bill Edwards is getting along. He did not

                    look like he had long to live when we saw him. I have thought about him often in the past month. I certainly hope he has gotten better since we saw him.</p>
                
                <p>I am sending you a color slide I took while we were there. You may keep it as I took several shots of you while I was there.</p>
                
                <p>Everyone here is fine &#8212; except Sally. She is popping out with chicken-pox. You can imagine the job we have trying to keep her down!</p>
                
                <p>We hope to come up sometime during the latter part of August so perhaps we will see you then.</p>
