Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>Marion and I would like to be with you on your eightieth birthday, but due to necessary refrains in the front of our car and the uncertain wether conditions, it will be impossible for us to be with you and family, but we are remembering the occassion with a small gift we mailed yesterday from Mau's Land. We hope this gift given with affection, will replace our absence. We plan to see you all somethime during the spring or early summer. Until then we wish you many more happy birthdays.</p>
Yours Sincerely,
E. Leigh and Marion G. Brown
