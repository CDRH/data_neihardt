John Neihardt:
<p>Heard Edsel Ford read some of his "stuff" the other evening (21 Nov). Thought you'd like to have a copy of his latest -- 1st day of issue was the 21st over at the Jewish Community Center, here in KC.</p>

<p>How goes it? Do I understand correctly that 800 Rubles was recently produced at Grand Island? Great, of course, if such be true!!!</p>

<p>Am still writing the Neihardt: Western Writings mss. Hope to finish it soon. Then off to you to see if I've gotten my facts straight.</p>

<p>Am "Associate Feature Editor" for the KC STAR now (sounds impressive, doesn't it?) Get to edit all kinds of historical manuscripts which I, of course, find to be no real work at all Did one the other day on</p>
<p>our friend Custer and Black Kettle down at the Washita. We illustrated it with pics of Custer, Black Kettle and a cut from the HARPERS WEEKLEY of Dec. 1868 showing the Cheyenne village. Hope maybe readers might get the impression we're not really the "good guys" after all.</p>
<p>Must close. Best to the Youngs.</p>
