Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>I noticed an article in the Des Moines Sunday Register announcing the celebration of your 80th birthday this past Sunday. I had no idea you had reached such a distinctive age...and now am more impressed than ever with the outstanding course in critical essay writing I enjoyed under your instruction last spring.</p>
<p>Many of the basic truths you helped us "discover" are still with me and I share them with others whenever possible.</p>
<p>Presently I'm working as an advertising copywriter in the Promotion Department of the Des Moines Register and Tribune. However, in February I must begin my six months' duty with they army reserves at Ft. Leonard Wood, Missouri. If you are still teaching, I will be most happy to attempt to find you in an idle moment some day this spring.</p>
<p>My most sincere congratulations to you on the occasion of your 80th birthday...and my most sincere thanks to you for the lasting impression you and your course have left upon me.</p>
Sincerely,
