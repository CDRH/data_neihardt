                <p>Your letter was a gift from heaven, but sometimes, I suppose we must struggle to reach the goals such gifts deserve.</p>
                
                <p>The man on whom I had every justification to depend seemed joyously interested in collaborating on the "Song of Hugh Glass" article &#8212; has become a sadly changed personality now. Some months ago he gave up a job, planning to earn his living by writing. "Fate" has accepted two of his articles, published in the Feb. <unclear>cruncher</unclear> (+ he won a poetry prize (though I feel he exaggerat<unclear>ed</unclear> his abilities as a poet. Shortly after this he sent another article to Fate (in Feb.) they did not pay for it, return it,
                
                    <fw type="curatorial">20</fw>

                    <fw type="authorial"><hi rend="underline">2</hi></fw>
                
                    nor given him any comment, so he says he has lost all interest in the magazine. Especially when he subscribed to "Fate," + they omitted sending him an issue one month.</p>
                
                <p>I told him (on the phone) to ask the editor why he had not heard from them. Hope he will. This man writes a surprisingly good letter. He had one poem published <add>"<unclear>Ajax</unclear>"</add> by a local poetry magazine, wh<del>o</del><add>ich</add> however, do<add>es</add> not <hi rend="underline"><unclear>pay</unclear></hi> for verse. He devotes himself <add>now</add> to his printing press</p>
                
                <p>You have I'm sure divined that I attempt now not in vanity or ambition, but am I too audacious only to <unclear>help</unclear> feeling that I don't wish publication of what is considered unworthy of paying. I still remember that Harriet Monroe published me [infrequently yet asked for more with her check. <unclear>May</unclear> Gustave would say, "now shall we

                    return it?" We always did. &#8212; But I can't do this now, Doch zeir Luche. (I think you speak German)</p>
                
                <p>I will try to query "Fate" on their interest in the article. I thnk I can get other collaboration, which is necessary for though I deeply look forward to hearing the recording, my diminished sight would make note-taking impossible. Daughter <unclear>Margaret</unclear> suggests any good magazine, <unclear>such as Atlantic</unclear> or Harpers should be interested in this experience of a historical poet, if the article is well written. What do you think? Your experience gives me lofty fascination. Margaret is overloaded with work, as the secretary to her teacher husband <unclear>and</unclear> good <del/> wife (attending many meetings, working the garden, her activities

                    with the "League of Women Voters," radio + television appearances. She keeps no maid, + is also a good daughter, reading to me the letters I receive. Typing my important letters that I may make corrections, + then write them over. (it is usually impossible for me to read my own caligraphy or any other.)</p>
                
                <p>So with all these obstacles I still have eagerness for this remarkable experience in poetry, + will feel frustrated if I negate your faith in me. (I wonder do you know of any other instance in which a poet divined the locale with the 'inner eye'?)</p>
                
                <p>Do not impose upon yourself a long letter, dear friend, only write if you feel you wish to give some advice.</p>

                <p>You will realize that my quasi-literary activities are not of vanity but (<hi rend="underline">also</hi>) something in retribution in my life for which I am not completely irresponsible. Were Gustave with me, how different everything would be!</p>
                
                <p>Blessings on you, + those dear to you. It gives me more faith in life when I see another place so brave + achieving <del>her</del> <add>significant</add> desires.</p>
