Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>I am so very sorry that I can't attend your birthday celebration tomorrow. I had hoped it would be possible, but as it isn't, I want to extend to you nevertheless my congratulations on your 80th birthday, and my best wishes for the furture.</p>

<p>You have been an inspiration to many of us since you camp to our campus.</p>
Sincerely,
Elsa Nagel
P.S. I have several times recommended your books to my german friends as examples of good American literature.
