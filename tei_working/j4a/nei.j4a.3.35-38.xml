<salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt, &#8212;</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am delighted to know of "Hugh Glass", and predict for it a great success; if it has a sufficient amount of yourself in it, judging by your books and your letters, it has nothing to fear. Please let me know who your publisher is to be so that I can order a copy in advance. I know you have found your real field. I sense it in every word of yours I have read. And there is no more fertile field. The wonder is, no one has seen it long before this. And yet, perhaps, no <emph><hi rend="underline">wonder.</hi></emph> Our authors are so afraid of life, so more than afraid of emotion &#8212; so fettered by the rules and traditions of composition. Very important these, of course, 

<pb facs="nei.j4a.3.35-38_0002"/>
<fw type="curatorial">36</fw>

<unclear>but</unclear> fetters, just the same, until an author can &#8212; &#8212; slope around in them, if you'll excuse the expression and <unclear>mixture</unclear>. I have meant to keep your secret, but have divulged it to my wife and two <hi rend="caps">other</hi> friends, only less intimate, from whom I have no &#8212; well, hardly any &#8212; secrets. These are all as safe as the grave, <del>for secrets</del> and together make up the <hi rend="caps">C. D.</hi> of whom <title><foreign>"Brunelleschi"</foreign></title> is dedicated. <unclear>There</unclear> you have a secret, <del/> which only these <unclear>three</unclear> <del/> share, so you may judge how well I am keeping yours. And here is another! I am working now on "Pheidias"; to the sculptor what <title><foreign>"Brunelleschi"</foreign></title> is the architect. When I say working, I ought to say incubating, however, I have got only <emph><hi rend="underline">one line</hi></emph> <unclear>thru Jan</unclear>; but that the pith and crux of the thing &#8212; "This clay is vehicle of godhead!" There are to be three divisions. I. Olympia. To Zeus. <hi rend="underline">Power.</hi> II. Delphi. To Apollo. <emph><hi rend="underline">Beauty.</hi></emph> III. Athens. 

<pb facs="nei.j4a.3.35-38_0003"/>
<fw type="curatorial">37</fw>
<fw type="authorial">2.</fw>

  To Athena. <emph><hi rend="underline">Wisdom.</hi></emph> Much of it will be monologue; some of it dialogue; with connecting passages of narrative and description, and interspersals of lyric. A great canvas! The Olympic Festival in the first part, which stands (<unclear>then</unclear>) for <emph><hi rend="underline">Life.</hi></emph> Then the Pythian games in the second part <del/> glimpse <emph><hi rend="underline">Mystery.</hi></emph> And, in the third part, the Dionysiac Celebration gives opportunity for <emph><hi rend="underline">Inspiration.</hi></emph> <unclear>Thus</unclear> all the gorgeous fabric is to be woven the serene sure gentle strength of the great seer, the realizer of godhead in clay. His career, his work, is  strangely like that of Socrates, of Daedalus, of Christ. His character <del/> <unclear>mingles the three</unclear>. Socrates was of the family of Daedalus, the sculptors' gens, &#8212; perhaps Pheidias came of like stuff. And the final scene of Socrates and Pheidias is the same, &#8212; prison, &#8212; poison; at least I take this one of two possible endings, both violent, and both resulting from accusations of blasphemy, in-

<pb facs="nei.j4a.3.35-38_0004"/><fw type="curatorial">38</fw>

  itially <del/> the same as with Socrates. A tremendous subject! Can I do it? By God! I must!</p>

<p>And then the third member of my trilogy &#8212; to the painter what <title>Pheidias</title> and <title><foreign>"Brunelleschi"</foreign></title> are to sculptors and architects. Perhaps "Rembrandt," perhaps a modern, ideal figure; the form still inchoate. For <title>"Pheidias"</title> I am reading, reading, reading But it is <unclear>swinging</unclear> into being!</p>

<p>Your wife &amp; mine <del/><add>will</add> have much in common. Mine, bless her! studied in Paris<add>, too</add> &#8212; painting. It was there we found each other. I am writing in the midst of Bedlam. Please excuse any incoherence.</p>

<salute>Yours devotedly</salute>
