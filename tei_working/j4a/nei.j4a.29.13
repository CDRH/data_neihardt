Dear John:
<p>I regret very much that Mrs. Ellis and I had to miss your birthday dinner Sunday but we want to add our congratulations to those of your other friends and to give you the best wishes possible for what we hope will be many more years of activity. We certainly treasure having you in the community as you add a great deal to it.</p>
Sincerely yours,
