Skyrim Farm
Route 7
Columbia, Missouri

Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>May I add my belated congratulations on your 80th birthday anniversary to the host of others I am sure you have received. My Mother sent clippings from the Columbia newspapers telling of the grand celebration in your honor. It seems to me the most fitting tribute of all came from Mr. Finch who said: "You are an inspiration to many students." However, I would amend it ot say "all your students," for I am sure that no one could leave your classes without being enriched by you and your teachings.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are surprised to see we now are in North Dakota. Joe has been practicing law here since last fall, and we are enjoying new surroundings and meeting new friends. If the weatherman will cooperate we hope to see more of the state and to get up into Manitoba. But we are looking forward to returning to Columbia for the summer this year. Joe and I both plan to attend the summer session at M.U. I hope we will be able to have a nice visit with you then. We have been home twice for brief visits since we last saw you, but the first time the weather was so unpleasant that we hardly ventured off the farm and the other time the baby was wick so that our visiting was confined to those who came to the house.</p>
<p>The "baby" is now almost two years old. He is a very happy and lively little fellow; a real boy. I can just imagine how much fun he will have this summer on the farm. His greatest love is to be outdoors, and a problem up here is that it's so cold he can't be out very long. the natives say, though, that we are having a mild winter this year. The Almanad predicts a mild, dry February and a hot and dry summer. But the definition of mild here is questionable.</p>
<p>The <underline>Bismarck Tribune</underline> will publish February 28 an historic edition called "The 100th Anniversary of Dakota Territory, 1861-1961." I have ordered a copy to be sent to you. I thought you might enjoy looking over it. You should receive it early in March.</p>
<p>Joe joins me in sending you very best wishes, as always.</p>
Cordially yours,
<signed>Martie</signed>
