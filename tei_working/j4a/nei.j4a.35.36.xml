March 15, 1971

Dear Nebraska Writer:
<p>On April 24, 1971, the Nebraska Council of Teachers of English plans to <underline>celebrate Nebraska Writers</underline> at its annual spring conference. We would like to have you with us on that day if it is possible for you to attend, for you are part of what helps to make Nebraska Number One.</p>
<p>We have prepared a program that should be interesting not only to teachers of English but also to the writers of Nebraska. Dr. Ruth Crone, co-author with Marion Marsh Brown of <underline>Willa Cather: Her Life and Times</underline>, will be the keynote speaker. Dr. John G. Neihardt, poet laureate of Nebraska, is our honored luncheon speaker. We will also have members of the Omaha Writers Club as panelists. Mildred Bennett of Red Cloud will speak to us about Willa Cather and Mr. Robert Reilly will speak to us about the independent writer. Hopefully we will also be able to celebrate Mari Sandoz at a special session.</p>
<p>The meeting will be at the Conference Center of the University of Nebraska at Omaha form 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Following the luncheon we would be glad to have the writers visit with teachers at will.</p>
<p>If you can't attend, would you be willing to take time out to write a letter wishing success to this ambitious project? Thank you for your time and we hope we'll see you on April 24.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Sister Mary Adolorata Watson</signed>
