Dear John Neihardt,
<p>Since I cannot attend the birthday dinner, I must take this way of being there in spirit.</p>
<p>In honoring you tonight,we, your many friends, are really honoring ourselves. Your eighty years of rich, productive living have added stature to each of us privileged to call you friend.</p>
<p>And so, on this happy occasion, congratulations to you, poet, philosopher, teacher, good friend and neighbor!</p>
Sincerely,
Florence E. Boehmer
