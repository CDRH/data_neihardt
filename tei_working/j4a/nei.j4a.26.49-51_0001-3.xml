                    <salute>Dear John,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I'm really giving the old typewriter a workout on these records. This is good for me though. I used to hate to write letters but now it is almost becoming habitual.</p>
                
                <p>I think the idea of a circular is fine. If you need any photographs that I have here let me know and I'll send them to you. Keep track of all the expenses because that should all be considered into the total cost of getting the records on the market. It <hi rend="underline">shouldn't</hi> come out of your pocket.</p>
                
                <p>Have you announced to the class yet about the records nearly being ready? They will not be ready to ship until the middle of March but every advance sale we can make will help. It has cost more to get the records ready than I thought it was going to. It looks like it is going to run close to $300 and I have only about $200 that I can tie up in them. So you might mention to the class that anyone who buys a record now is materially helping to put the records on the market. Whatever I can't make on advance s<del>l</del><add>a</add>les I will have to borrow and that is a little difficult out here s<del>e</del><add>i</add>nce I am not known here. The price on the advance sales is $3.35. As soon as they become availabe in book and record stores I will not be able to se<del>e</del><add>l</add>l them at that price.</p>
                
                <p>What do you think of autograph<del>n</del><add>i</add>ng the first hundred records? I hope to sell close to that many <del>o</del><add>i</add>n advance sales and I think it would be nice if those who bought records in advance had autographed copies. If it is alright I will send the covers as soon as I recieve them from the printer. You can autograph them and send them back to me and I will mail them out to those who have ordered to that date.</p>
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.26.49-51_0002"/>
                
                <fw type="curatorial">50</fw>
                
                <p>I think I told you in my last letter that Bill was interested only if we waited and sent out a mailer. I wrote back and told him I wanted to go ahead without waiting and so far he hasn't answered. So I presume he is not interested. At any rate I am going ahead with them on my own. The records will come out under the name, "<hi rend="caps">ORION RECORDS</hi>." (If you have a circular printed, have it done with this name as the brand name.)</p> 
                
                <p>I plan to take the material to the printer Monday, it will probably be a week or so before the covers are done. And I got a letter from the pressing company. The first pressing was excelle<del>tn</del><add>nt</add> but they didn't separate the selections by a band so I ask them to do them over. They said that since the first <del>pr</del><add>ma</add>sters were so good they were afraid to try again because of the amount of time envol<del>b</del><add>v</add>ed<sic>involved</sic>. They said they would if I insisted but <del>i</del><add>d</add>idn't want to. So I said that the first ones they did would be alright. I think that there is enough of a pause between he passages that it will be clear to the listener that there is a break in continuity. The second reason I decided not to have them <del>p<unclear/>t</del><add>do</add> them over again was that if they s<del>pe</del><add>ep</add>erated them with bands it would take that much more space on the record and since the material in a very long anyway, that would run the recorded material in very close to the center. This is not good from the standpoint of fid<del>i</del><add>e</add>lity. Is this alright with you?</p>
                
                <p>By the way. We have sold two records so far. Ishmael Gardner (a member of the Speech Department) and Sandra Cohen (one of your students?) have sent checks. So we are <del>i</del><add>a</add>t least in business now.</p>
