Dear John,
<p>I am sorry I did not get to your dinner. The announcenment was forwarded to Harlan too late to get back here. I heard about the dinner late Sunday afternoon but had so tied myself up for the evening (<unclear>be sure to write</unclear>) that I couldn't make it.</p>
<p>I assure you that none of your many friends admire you and like you <unclear>some</unclear> claim I do.</p>
Signed yours,
Harlin Craig
