                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I hate to type. I am mailing you "The Iron Muse" autographed, contents marked. I hope to be at Peconic, <hi rend="caps">R.I.-N.Y.</hi> for a month or so about Aug. 7th. I bought a lot of Books this spring, two hundred for this Colony Library and some for your self. I think I have the Friends at Peconic. If I have to choose now I'd say <hi rend="caps">H.G.</hi> 800 Rubles I know and like. I have read the introductions to both the Songs. The critical study you mention and your Poetry lecture will be welcome at any time in any form. If you will send or promise me your Splendid Wayfarer<sic>Wayfaring</sic> I will mail you one of my few remaining copies of Processionals before I start West in September. After a month or so in Chicago, I hope to fare farther, certainly to Santa Fe probably to California by or before Xmas. I'm sorry you seem so dead against free verse. You sound as if you get a lot of good from it in the Bible if not elsewhere. I've a book of <hi rend="caps">N.M.</hi> five poems which might interest you otherwise, besides War Flames. I never used this medium until 1915, and I shall probably go on experimenting with what seems to me a fascinating and flexible new technic for some time yet. Like Frost I have no prejudice one way or another. Robinson feels as you do <unclear/> far from intellectually <unclear/> I <unclear>mentioned</unclear> you to him, <unclear>he later</unclear> <unclear/> I am the <unclear/> I am the <unclear/> but admits that the latter may be an advance technically. Frost does not know your stuff. He says he reads very little poetry. I don't want to be <unclear>officious</unclear> but I think if you were to send him one of the songs he'd appreciate it. I got a letter from him this morning which I'm about to answer and am going to risk my reputation as a critic with him by saying about have just <unclear>said</unclear> to him. I hope you don't mind because <unclear/> Percy MacKaye says Poetry should be advertized much of the free verse I hate about in <unclear/> but you do <unclear/> much <unclear/>. I'm taking a <unclear>fairly severe line</unclear> with a good <unclear/> my ten buts. You and Frost, within your limitations and <unclear/> are exceptional. Can't you get anything out of Whitman nowadays? More and more, <unclear>abroad</unclear> as well <unclear>as at home is</unclear> <unclear/> come to stay. Say what you like or don't like, but we <unclear/> a great deal of American poetry today is obviously lacking and I don't know much about the business stuff, but <unclear>when I</unclear> <unclear/> at least three, I get it.</p> <closer><salute>Sincerely</salute> <signed>John Curtis Underwood</signed></closer>
