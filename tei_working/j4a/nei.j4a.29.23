Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>In 1964, New Jersey will celebrate the 300th anniversary of the granting by the Duke of York to John Lord Berkeley, Baron of Statton and Sir George Carteret of Saltrum the land of Nova Caesarea, or New Jersey.</p>
<p>We hope to make this Tercentenary celebration a time of stock taking, of reviewing an important past and of thinking about where we might be heading. This will not be an antiquarian exercise, nor a chauvinistic and parochial attempt to claim that all good things have begun in New Jersey. Rather, in the belief that men do not identify with man unless they have a sense of locality and of state, we want to tell a New Jersey story that our six million citizens may come ot know and within which they can find themselves.</p>
<p>In this regard, I wonder if you have had a New Jersey experience, or know a New Jersey story, that you would care to relate? If you would liek to share your New Jersey experience of story with us, I would appreciate hearing from you.</p>
<p>This is not a publishing venture, for as you know far better than I, nothing may come of this effort to gather together the brief New Jersey reflections of you and a hundred or so of your contemporaries. On the other hand, should we recieve a substandtial response, I feel certain we can prevail upon William Sloan at the Rutger's Press to print a small volume for issue at the time of the Tercentenary.</p>
<p>I shall look forward to hearing from you. Best regards.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Robert C. Crane</signed>
Robert C. Crane, Senator
Chairman
