Dear Lulu:
<p>It was good to hear from you, and it was very good of you to write, considering my long silence.</p>
<p>I had not heard about Jim's death, and I wrote at once to his wife, whome I know. Jim and I were really friends, altho' we didn't write letters; we "clicked", and I feel a very warm affection for him.</p>
<p>You and Donald should consider yourselves very successful people, with two thoroughly fine sons, and both prospering. Surely you must feel many thrills of happiness when you think of such good fortune. <underline>I</underline> think of them oftener than you might suppose.</p>
<p>Mona and I are rattling around in this too large house. We do miss all the youngsters, beginning with 'Laine and Joan and going right on up. They are all such dear, good kids. The place here is very beautiful. You would hardly know it. But the beauty is a bit saddening at times for lack of youngsters.</p>

<p>I am having wonderful luck with The Song of Jed Smith, the final piece in my Cycle. It will appear next year, and MacMillians are eager for it. They plan to publish the whole Cycle in one volume.</p>
<p>Mona and I will spend the first two weeks of October on a car trip to Denver, Boulder etc. Last summer we spent nearly a month in the Alleghenies of Pennsylvania Lecturing, of course.</p>
<p>How do you and Donald like the present world? Ain't she a honey? Golly, what a world!</p>
<p>Tell Donald I like him a lot and always did. I'd like to take a look at him - and at you too.</p>
Love, 
Jno.
