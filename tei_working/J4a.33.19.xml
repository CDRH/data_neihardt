Lincoln, Nebraska

Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>We shall be glad to xerox the two pages you wrote about <underline>Bundle of Myrrh</underline> which are included in the copy we have here in the library. We are uncertain, however, whether you wich us to send it directly to the people at Syracuse, or if you want it sent to you for forwarding to them. As soon as we hear from you in the matter, we shall get it in the mail.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Nancy C Prewitt</signed>
