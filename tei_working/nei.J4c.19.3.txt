<p>Dear Mrs. Berg:</p>

	<p>I'm delighted to hear from you again! I don't forget you and Mrs. Graves - faithful ones!</p>
	<p>My son and I will leave for a lecture trip in the East early Friday morning. If I don't get to see you, come on anyway. Mona will be here and happy to visit with you. She says: "Tell the three ladies to spend a night with me". There'll be plenty of room.
	<p>If you come, Mona can tell you about the completion of the <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi>.</p>
                    
                            <p>Kindest thoughts</p>
