Dear Mrs. Prewitt:
Miss Linda DeLowry of Pittsburgh University is writing a doctoral dissertation on my work. She has
asked me for permission to use my manuscripts in your collection. 
I am writing this to give her limited permission. So far as I am concerned, she may study anything
in the collection and may take notes while studying in your department. She may xerox a page or so
as illustrations of method but she is not being given permission to reprint any considerable section
of my work without consulting me further. 
Sincerely,
John Neihardt
