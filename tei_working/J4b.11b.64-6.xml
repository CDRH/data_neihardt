Dearest Girls: 
Everything going the best ever The climactic scene of the Messiah has me breathless. Mama's head of the is over. I asked the P-D for a vacation to begin next Monday & expect it to be granted. (With Jay of course, checks sent to you.) Have sent stuff for next Sunday, The two following Sundays should be empty needn't send any books tell further notice. I wish I could sneak up & hear Hiddy reading my stuff aloud! Of course I'm tickled to hear of it. Mama & I will have fried spring chicken tomorrow - bought a 2 1/2 eb fry for 11c a pound. Had fresh filet of haddock today for dinner - 13 c of a cob. 
The weather here is bully - warm without heavy air. I get to working at 5:30 or 6:00 a.m & keep it going until 11. The afternoons are ages long. It's light still at 9 P.m here. 
Tom Mix's trains so here today. 
We're not going. (over)

Thanks awfully for all your care in handling things, old Lady Enot. 
Hiddy & Alice, I'm writing on the table where one ate last September, & I'm thinking very cowardly things about you Hug Dan and grunt fervently for me! 
Endless love
Dad 
Enot, how does the cash hold up? will you, by any chance, have a surplus this Friday? Did you have enough to go around last Friday? If you have more than you need & can spare five bucks, you could let me have as much - but only if you don't really need it. I have quite a nice little bunch of money, but like to feel good & safe at this distance from home plate.
