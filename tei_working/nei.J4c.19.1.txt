                                March 20, '40





Mr. George Steele Seymour,
4917 Blackstone Avenue,
Chicago, Illinois.



<p>Dear Seymour:</p>

	<p>Of course I shall be glad to serve as Chairman of the committee, and certainly it's an honor to follow Hamlin Garland.</p>
	<p>It would be fine to have William Allen White and Ellen Glasgow. How about Gladys Hasty Carrol, Conrad Richter of Santa Fe, Frost, Stephen Benet, Joseph Auslander?</p>
	<p>I'm far along with The Song of Jed Smith, the central narrative of my Cycle, and the last. Having a particularly happy time with it and expect to be ready for publication in the spring of '41. I shall have spent 18 years out of the past 27 on the Cycle. This might be the news you want for the Bookfellows.</p>

		<p>I want to see you again.</p>

                           <p>Kindest thoughts,</p>
                      <signature>Jno. G. Neihardt</signature>
