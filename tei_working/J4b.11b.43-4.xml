Dearest Girls:
Bully letters, & we were made happy. It was a long wait for mail. Not much to say from here, & Mama has written, I notice I wrote for P-D Tues. and Wed. This morning I was up with the birds & at the Messiah again Broke through the wall in great hope, or maybe the wall just evaporated - at any rate, I'm close ot the finish & am grateful for the way the stuff develops.

yes Enot I too am eager for that Salt Lake - Desert - Pyramid Lake - New Mexico trip. Great stuff to contemplate! I wish all of us could be together on that trip. 
We're happy here. Mama has dove some plain & fancy sleeping that was certainly good for her. She doesn't weigh more than 2 or 3 hundred pounds yet, but she's doing well! 
Can't tell where we're going next. Maybe Long Pine - but send mail to Norfolk

until further notice - Great about Harrison! Hooray! I've written to Sig. & Max. 
Yes, Hiddy, that doc is a picker, I fear. We can have your teeth fixed, & your history reading is worth a lot more than $3.50 a week. The unholy guts it takes to offer that! 
Tell Dan, Alice, that I've met a lot of dogs - some of high degree, but most only dogs - and he's the loveliest of them all.

But he must it break any more laws & get arrested & woke his poor old Uncle pay fines. 
Endless love 
Dad. 
Bully about the recommendation from Minsey's. That will help greatly.
