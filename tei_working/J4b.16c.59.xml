Dearest Children:
<p>We have seen the most wonderful irrigated farms one could dream of, and have talked much of you running one maybe! If! - You would love them as we do, and Enid <underline>what perfect Homes</underline>, and grand tall trees! Never any crop failures! Everything too good almost for this Earth! And what mountains! WE book like it here better than in any other part of the U.S.</p>
Love to you both,
from Mom &amp; Daddy
