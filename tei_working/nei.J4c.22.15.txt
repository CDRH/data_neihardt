<p>Dear Lucile:</p>
	<p>I am wondering if you <hi rend="underline">are</hi> sick. I hope not. Your last letter was dated Oct. 14. Dr. McCurdie will be in today to give me <hi rend="underline">my</hi> copy of the dissertation. I'm eager to have it, you know!</p>
	<p>One of these days you may have a list of questions for me to answer on tape. I've just heard that kinescopes will be made of <hi rend="underline">Fetterman's Fight</hi>, <hi rend="underline">Beecher's Island</hi>, and The Death of Crazy Horse. <hi rend="underline">Jed Smith</hi> seems to hit especially hard. I don't quite know why.</p>
