Dear Dr. John.....
Your birthday and reading of Sigurd's death have had you much in my thoughts these recent weeks. Your dedication of Hugh Glass "To Sigurd, scarcely three" were the first lives of yours I ever read. I was about 13 at the time. 
I think I know something of your acceptance of the inexorable turn of time, and what those turns bring to all of us. 
In friendship and understanding, bless you! 
Faithfully,
Harold.
