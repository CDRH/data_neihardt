Dear Slade:

    <p>I am delighted with your articles on my <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>! It is a very effective way of presenting the work &#8212; far better than mere comment however
enthusiastic. You could go on to other and yet other articles too. Many, many thanks, my dear friend!</p>
    <p>I'm really interested in your trip around the Mediterranean! It must have been

thrilling, and I wish I could have been with you to talk over the long, long past!</p>
    <p>I've just returned from the highway marker dedication at Bancroft. It was a super-wow! The state officials who were there said we had the largest crowd ever assembled for
a highway dedication in Nebraska! The highway was blocked for nearly 1/4 of a mile!

After the doings on the highway (I spoke from a truck) the crowd went to the city park and we had a big get-together! I was amazed at the progress made on the study restoration 
project and the Prayer Garden. Beautiful!</p>
    <p>This is done in a hurry. I'm just back &#8212; and a bit tired. Hilda, Alice

and the girls went along. We drove in two cars.</p>
  
    <p>With affection to both of you</p> &#8212;
