Dear Lucile:

<p>I've just heard from Mr. Szasz, the Hungarian artist, who is a close friend of Mr. Webster Shott, the critic, who is a top man in the Hallmark Company. Szazs said that Shott had reviewed portions of your biography for Life magazine. He didn't say what conclusions Shott reached. Do you know yet? Hallmark is considering publishing some of my stuff and I understand that Shott is a real fan of mine. I do hope he thought of some way to utilize portions of your biography.</p>
