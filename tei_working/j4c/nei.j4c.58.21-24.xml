                </opener>
                <p>Here is the translation of the Greek dedication in <hi rend="underline">Three Friends</hi>. I was reading Sappho at the time, and I loved her description of her little girl, so like my Hilda. So I used three <del/>lines, which read, literally, as follows:</p>
                    
                    <lg><l>"Like a sweet apple on the topmost 
                    bough,</l>
                    <l>The very tip-toppest bough, that
                    the apple-pickers overlooked;</l>
                    <l>No, they did not overlook it;
                    they could not reach it."</l></lg>
                
                <p>My happy letters to you have shown how I feel about your <hi rend="caps">MS</hi>. We've read four chapters (up to 10 o'clock last evening), and the delight continues. It's excellent writing, Lucile! I've dictated comment for Florence to write on the margin &#8212; <hi rend="underline">mostly rejoicing</hi>. It was the same all through the fourth chapter, and we are eager to get going again.</p> <note type="authorial">(over)</note>
                    
                    <pb facs="nei.j4c.58.21-24_0002"/>

                <p>It's too bad you had not seen <hi rend="underline">800 Rubles produced</hi>, Lucile. If you had seen it, you could not possibly have made your comment on the Girl's closing song. I have seen the play produced five times, and the effect of the Girl's <add>happy</add> song heard in the distance and growing louder as she approaches, <del/> <hi rend="underline">is simply</hi> <hi rend="double underline">overwhelming</hi>. Its effect on the audiences was unquestionably great. The play was produced beautifully at the Stuhr Museum Theater <del/> near Grand Island last winter. They did it twice and could not accomodate <del>the</del> all who came to see.</p>
                
                <p>Lucile, you should look up Minnie Maddern Fiske. She was not merely "an actress of the time". She was regarded as one of the <hi rend="underline">Greats</hi>, and, I suspect, she still is so regarded. She has been dead 35 years, but she

                    she is in Random <add>House</add> Dictionary, a <hi rend="underline">very</hi> modern work.</p>
                
                <p>When I lectured at the Rockwell Temple Center in Cincinnati, <hi rend="underline">800 Rubles</hi> was produced in the Workshop Theater there. <del/> There was a lot of enthusiasm. The actress who played in it spent the evening with me at the <unclear>Sinton</unclear> Hotel, trying to persuade me to write a <hi rend="underline">full-length</hi> play for her. (I was busy with the Cycle).</p>
                
                <p>These people did not lack "grease paint", Lucile!</p>
                
                <p>But this is only a detail, and a slip-up. The mass of what you have done is <hi rend="underline">admirable</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">I am deeply greatful<sic>grateful</sic></hi> for it.</p>
                
                <p>You know my Jacquot (the divine poodle) I believe. Well, he is a <del/> dramatic critic! <del/> He attended both shows at the Stuhr Museum, and at the first one, he barked <del/> violently at the <hi rend="underline">mean old mother</hi>!!! <note type="authorial">(over)</note>

                    He made a sensation! But at the <hi rend="underline">second</hi> show he remained quiet, having learned that the white people were only "playing like", and didn't really mean it!</p>
                
                <p><del/>
                    <lb/>
                    I am still far from happy about the Ollie material. It would present me <del>to many in</del> <hi rend="underline">grotesquely out of focus</hi> to many nice people who do not know me. <del>There is no re<unclear/></del> I value the Rabelaisian strain in <del/> my nature, but I don't go around exhibiting it.</p>
                
                <p>You <hi rend="underline">could suggest</hi> by <hi rend="underline">describing</hi> instead of <hi rend="underline">quoting</hi>. This could be both amusing and effective.</p>
