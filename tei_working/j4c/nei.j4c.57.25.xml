                    <salute>Dear Sandy,</salute>
                </opener>
                
                <p>I have just been hearing your letters of last May and July read aloud to me and they have made me happy. Of late I have been wondering if I had misplaced you somewhere, as I am always doing with my glasses; but you seem to be as there as ever, and I am wishing mightily that I might see you like old times.</p>
                
                <p>Since writing you last I have had the second cataract operation, and it seems that both are reasonably sucessful. I shall have two eyes to use instead of one.</p>
                
                <p>I have been working rather steadily on my "autobiography" in spite of the eye troubles, and I now have forty thousand words, which is about half of the projected work. What I have done so far is really complete in itself, being concerned with my boyhood and early youth. I have half a notion to offer this for publication now and go ahead with another section. There is so much to do even when I limit the material as much as possible that it could not be put in one volume.</p>
                
                <p>Sandy, I am always hearing from this person and that person about the lack of records of my stuff. I am wondering if there cannot be some arrangement made whereby the records you have already made may be obtainable. At the same time I should think it might be possible to make records from some of the tapes we made when I was up there last. I do think they would sell reasonably well, Sandy. I suppose the initial cost is what spoils the deal, and I am sure there would be some way to manage that. What do you think about trying to get these things out?</p>
                
                <p>There was a feeling in your letters that made me glad. You are undoubtedly in a creative stage of your life, and you are going far with it. I wish you could include some records in your scheme of things.</p>
                
                <p>This carries affectionate thoughts for your lady and the children, as well as for you.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Your friend,</salute>
