                    <salute>Dear Sandy:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I was so glad to hear from you again that I am not waiting a moment to write you and say as much. It is a real joy to read of your successes in your field, and of the important work that you are doing now. Nothing of the sort surprises me for I have long known of you skill in these matters.</p>
                
                <p>You send your kind thougts to Alice, Enid, Hilda, Sigurd and the Youngs. They will be glad to hear from you. But I am sorry to report that old Sig is having a tough time. Some months ago he had a stroke and now he has come down with pneumonia. Enid, too, had a stroke several monts ago but she is coming out of it in great shape.</p>
                
                <p>As for me, things have been going very well indeed. I think you probably know how <hi rend="caps">BLACK ELK SPEAKS</hi> has been selling all over the United States and in Europe. We have just received a copy of a British edition published in London, and we have also received a request from the British Broadcasting Company for permission to make an hour program based on the book.</p>
                
                <p>I suppose you know that I am no longer with the University of Missouri. I began teaching at the age of 68 and quit at the age of 85 because of my eyes. My principal course entitled "The Twilight of the Sioux," has continued <add>by <hi rend="caps">TV</hi></add> and is attracting more students than ever. There are 250 now in the class and I am told it would be 500 if there were room for them.</p>
                
                <p>I am working on the second volume of my autobiography and have about one-half of it written. It will be quite different from the first volume which is concerned as you know with boyhood and youth.</p>
                
                <p>Sandy, you never told me about this novelette upon which you have been working for some years. I am greatly interested, as you know I would be, and I'm sure it's a good thing. Do tell me more about it when you have time.</p>
                
                <p>It is the best of news that you are happy in your marriage. Do give my warm regards to the lady.</p>
                
                <p>One of these days I may have occasion &#8212; I mean Hilda may have occasion &#8212; to write you about the two tapes you have of my stuff. Hilda does all my business, as you probably know.</p>
                
                <p>I have been living here with the Youngs for about four years now and it has become home. I am keeping Sky Rim<sic>Skyrim</sic> mostly for Alice to use in her business, and I am making some important improvements on it. I expect to go there now and then for a week or so at a time. Please give my warm regards to John Milton.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>With the old affection,</salute>
