                    <salute>Dear Slade,</salute>
                </opener>
                
                <p>Although I have not been corresponding directly with you, I have kept in touch through my friend, Mrs. Young. I am sure she has been telling you all of my news. You know of course that I have had my second eye operation for cataracts. Yesterday I had my new eyes tested for lenses and within a little more than a week I shall be looking through two eyes at a world that is sometimes too funny for one eye. As I have been recuperating, I have continued to work on my book, "The Old Man Remembers." I now have forty thousand words, which could be about half of the book I have in mind; and I expect to finish during this year. It is not possible to write a complete autobiography, and what I am doing is certainly not of a strict biographical nature in the ordinary meaning of that term. I am now about fifteen years old, but I am getting older fast and will soon be concerned with adult doings. Up to now I have been working on boyhood and youth, and I have found it actually entertaining. I often catch myself laughing heartily over my own life.</p>
                
                <p>Are you going to be in Missouri again this spring or summer? I expect to be in Missouri during April, and would it be bully if you were around about that time.</p>
                
                <p>How is Nita? I often think of her too and hope she is well, still watching her birds. She and Mrs. Young would be good pals in the bird business.</p>
                
                <p>My little dog is trying to get me to do something different and Ican't<sic>I can't</sic> tell what it is. You know him I think&#8212;&#8212;my poodle? He is one of the best friends I have ever had and takes care of me day and night.</p>
                
                <p>We have had ten solid weeks of winter, but yesterday and today there has been some melting.</p>
                
                <p>I still love you, Slade.</p>
                <closer>
