<salute>Dear Slade:</salute>
</opener>
<p>It was good to hear from you after too long a silence. Naturally, I am delighted to know that <hi rend="caps">ALL IS BUT A BEGINNING</hi> reached you. Your comments are especially interesting. You speak of my father, and I think you would understand him better than might be supposed. When I began writing the book, I had only fragmentary knowledge of him. I never quite understood him, but he certainly loved me althought he had a silent way of showing it. But as the book proceeded and I fitted the fragments into a mosaic unintentionally, I found that a man of a very definite personality emerged, and as a result I liked him better.</p>

<p>You would be interested to know that the United Artists is bringing out the first album of my poetry on September 16. There should be as many as 12 albums.</p>

<p>I wish you could visit Bancroft during Neihardt Day in August &#8212; the first Sunday in August. We had a wonderful time this year &#8212; 700 people turned up, and there is every indication that it is a going concern, not merely around Bancroft or the Middle West but reaching out far and wide. The National Observer recently had an article on a hitchiker from the west who was bound for the Neihardt Day celebration.</p>

<p>Thanks for sending me your friend's poetry. He certainly has beautiful poetic ideas, and I intend to read him more as soon as I am free to do so. My eyes are not too good.</p>

<p>I am afraid there is little hope of finding a publisher for poetry.</p>

<p>It's really astonishing how <hi rend="caps">BLACK ELK SPEAKS</hi> and <hi rend="caps">WHEN THE TREE FLOWERED</hi> have been selling. <hi rend="caps">BLACK ELK</hi> is translated into nine foreign tongues and is selling all over the United States as well as principal nations of Europe. In three months <hi rend="caps">WHEN THE TREE FLOWERED</hi> sold 115,000 copies. I don't understand it but it is pleasing because the success of the books cannot be attributed to sensationalism.</p>

<p>How is your health, Slade, and how is your good lady? It has been too long since I saw you last.</p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to tell you Val Peterson gave the principal speech at the Neihardt celebration, and it was a wonderful speech. He has been Ambassador to Denmark and Norway and for two years he served Nebraska as Governor.</p>

<p>Do plan to come out and see us next August. Why not?</p>

<salute>With the old affection,</salute>
