                <salute>Dear Slade:</salute>
                </opener>
                
                <p>Your latest letter to me comments on my lecturing at the Governor's Mansion way back in January! I am really surprised that so much time has passed, but it's the old story.</p>
                
                <p>I have just returned from another experience in Nebraska. You know this is Centennial year, and they are celebrating with increasing intensity. While I was there, the Governor gave me a trophy, bearing the legend "Nebraska's Poet of the Century." I also received a citation for being one of the "Ten Top Persons" in Nebraska history, I being the only living one of the ten. The choice was made by a poll of historians, history professors, and teachers of the state. The meaning is considerable when one notes what a large number of distinguished people have come from Nebraska. Even <hi rend="caps">J. J.</hi> Pershing didn't get into the ten, who were chosen for the contributions to Nebraska culture. I was astonished to be included by a poll of historians.</p>
                
                <p>I enclose an editorial from the Nebraska State Journal in Lincoln. The World-Herald has articles and pictures too. Also, the Retired Teachers' Ass'n. gave me a silver medal, a replica of the state seal.</p>
                
                <p>This all sounds like boasting, but it's my news, and I'm sharing it with my friend, principally because I know you care.</p>
                
                <p>I am deeply impressed with what you tell of your dream experience. It seems to have been what is called a viridical dream. Certainly, it has the ear-marks<sic>earmarks</sic>. I do believe you saw your mother. Such things are well-known, and innumerable instances of the sort have been recorded. The clarity of the vision is important, and also the youthfulness of the face that you had seen last as old &#8212;&#8212; that, too, is typical. It's a beautiful experience, Slade, and I'm glad you told me about it.</p>
                
                <p>Did I send you a photo of a levitated table? We have had very remarkable results from our experiments here. Dr. <hi rend="caps">J. B.</hi> Rhine of Duke University is greatly interested in us, and he's coming to see us this spring. I wouldn't believe what we have seen if the camera hadn't recorded it.</p>
                
                <closer>
                <salute>With affection for you and Nita as always,</salute>
