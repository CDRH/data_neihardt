                    <salute>Dear Slade:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>In one of your recent letters, I am told, you asked "what is the matter with John?" I have the answer. There is nothing the matter with John now. He had an attack of flu sometime back, but that is history and at present I am doing very well. The autobiography goes along beautifully and I am having a goood time writing it. At present I am between 15 and 16 years old. <hi rend="caps">THE DIVINE ENCHANTMENT</hi> is nearly completed and I am going to the old Nebraska Normal College and ringing the bell for my tuition. It's certainly a holidary story up to now and should become <del>l</del>more so as I am only now entering the adult world.</p>
                
                <p>Slade, things are really happening. Someone has spoken about a "Neihardt Revival." I do not think there is such a thing but our mail indicates a nation-wide interest that is growing.</p>
                
                <p>I did a<sic>an</sic> educational tv program a week ago on creative writing. It was first shown the 18th of November. Also on the 10th and 11th of October the tv station here a one-hour tape on "Neihardt: A Journey Home." It was done at Bancroft. They had ten techinicians there for two days and $150,00 worth of equipment. The directior told me yesterday that it is a very beautiful film and that he is proud of it. It will be given first on my birthday, January 8, and the management here hopes to have it on a national circuit.</p>
                
                <p>Last night I had a nice little triumph at the annual Phi Beta Kappa dinner here at the University. I recited my poetry from memory for an hour and received a rousing standing ovation. It was a picked audience, not used to being over-enthusiastic. But how they did come over, bless their hearts. </p>
                
                <p>I am having another eye operation in January and I am hoping to see better when I have two eyes. My programs are given now by memory because of my eye trouble. I just can't read without a powerful magnifying glass, and illuminated at that. I am quite sure, however, that after the operation it will be easier to write the autobiography and that is all I care about now.</p>
