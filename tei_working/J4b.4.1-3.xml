Jan. 3rd 23
Dearest Miss Piper! 
You were perfectly sweet to send me those beautiful stockings, and I appreciate them, and the kind thoughts you took of me! Many, many thanks! 
The children were de-
lighted write your funny ani-mals! I am keeping mother's package for her, as she is so "on the go" now, and I think she will enjoy her xmas gifts more upon her return to home and quiet. 
Baby Alice is such a big

girl now, and talks so sweetly! 
I wish she had been as big as she is now last summer, so that I could have gone about more with you! 
Mother has been having a lovely time, and I am so glad she could go. 
John leaves for his next trip north on the eleventh. 
We are all well and as happy as now be-
I hope you had a lovely time Christmas, and that she new year holds much good for you! 
Ever cordiallly- Mona Neihardt
