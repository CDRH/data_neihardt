Darling Hilda and Albert:
<p>Are you in class 1 or are you not? This is the one, great question for us here. Please remember that we love you devotedly and are all with you in your quest for happiness. No matter what may come Love is <underline>all</underline> important. You have started and there is great joy and great sorrow in store for you. Whatever you do my deep love and sincere admiration yours <underline>always</underline>.</p>
<p>I am glad you are pleased with the wedding pictures. You must have a few more than you ordered, I added those for Amama. When you find them please send them to her <underline>here</underline></p>

<p>She is now planning to leave September first or second so you may plan to come after us, Daddy and me, if you want to - and can - any day, and we will be greatly obliged to you. Just Keep us informed.</p>
<p>Amama must get back to Ottocar she feels, before he leaves on another long trip; So <underline>that</underline> is <underline>that</underline>! - She Knows that I want her, and may be she will regret having left me, but nevertheless: go she must and will.- God bless and help her.</p>
<p>My bust is in the mold and a beautiful job according to Daddy and Amama and satisfying to me too - so I am much relieved -</p>
<p>The Sea born is now for a floating flower and very lovely in cement. The new edition of my stump baby is about ready for a rubber mold -</p>
Loads of Love from
