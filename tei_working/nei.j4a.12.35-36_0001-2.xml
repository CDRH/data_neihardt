                <p>Chancellor Avery left after the meeting of the Board, and did not get to tell me, except by memoranda which he left, just what he wanted me to do. I have thought out the details with a slight change, and now submit the plan. The idea was that you should carry regular half-tume teaching, putting all into one semester. On deliberation, it seems to me much better that you should not bunch the service, but with the understanding that gaps may be made when you go out on an itinerary, <del>but</del> be here both semesters, and give two courses, one of three hours, and one of two, making a daily programme of one hour, &#8212; five hours a week, as you are able, being in town, to meet it. There would be one course, the one on values and criticism, running criticism on books of the day, coming Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The other one, on poetics and values in content and form, this course calling for a Tuesday and Thursday exercise. Each course would involve written exercises, and the sufficient time of an assistant, leaving you only the lecture presentation. What captured Dr. Avery's enthusiasm was the idea that you could use the syndicate substance so as not to do any preparing, for the main course. He believes he can make the compensation $2250 the year. The scale is not of course what it should be, since with us hardly less than two lectures a day could count for full time. We have, of course, no endowment funds.</p>
                
                <p>I regret that we could <add>not</add> have had a day to thresh this thing out. To me it seems ideal, sice it removes all the difficulties that had obsessed my mind, and especially the one that seemed to postulate a regulation professorial grind. I hope you can see it in the same perspective<del><unclear>h</unclear></del>that <del><unclear>do</unclear></del><add>I</add> do.</p>

                <p>The idea of an hour programme for two semesters, instead of a two-hour for one, has an advantage that may not be at once apparent. When a course is given for one semester, the student is obliged to provide work for the same hours, and in the line of his specialty or major. If he cannot plan for his continuation, he does not take the odd semester work. I look for a couple of hundred registrations, for the whole year, in lieu of what might <add>not</add> amount to more than half that number for one half-year. This, of course, for the critical hour. On the side of the poetics, the half-year plan would get you a bunch of non-descripts. The other arrangement would secure, by proper exclusion, a class to whom the right evangel<del>e</del> would be and mean salvation.</p>
                
                <p>I note that you are on a 'spurt' to catch up. I hope the spurt is over, and that the tempterature in the mountains is much below one hundred. That is what we are catch<add>ing</add> here just now.</p>
                
                <p>I should add that the question of campus sentiment is taken care of,&#8212; if the arrangement we covet appeals at all to you. The campus people cannot object to a regular addition to the instructional corps, but dislike whatever looks to them like a gratuity, so do some Board members also.</p>
                
                <p>Mrs. Sherman and I look forward to an early revisit with us.</p>
                
                <p>Here's hope and here's praying for the plan.</p>
