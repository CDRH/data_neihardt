                </opener>
                <p>One day my son went to the public library here in Waukesha and came home with your book entitled, "The Song of <add>the</add> Indian Wars." Your poems entitled "Fort Philip Kearney" and "The Wagon Boxes" mention my Beloved father. The later having been his own fight. His name by which he was retired from service was (Capt. James Powell) but for his famous defeat of (Red Cloud) in the (Wagon Box) he received (<unclear>Brert</unclear> Lt. Col.) Commission. Do you know whether Sergant<sic>Sergeant</sic> Littman of St. Louis and Sergant<sic>Sergeant</sic> Max Gibson are both living and their present address. Have you <del>red</del> read "Indian Fights and Fighters." By (Cyrus <unclear>Lounsence</unclear> Brady) He was a relative of my Fathers and his article in the above mentioned book regarding my Father is entitled The Thirty-Two against Three Thousand. How well I

                    can recollect my mother telling me about those days of strife. I have my fathers letters to mother during those days yellowed with age. Also from the Civil War written in the trenches before Atlanta. Also his Commission's, one signed by "Abraham Lincoln." Could you tell me where you got your information about the fights. Maybe I could have helped you somewhat had I have known it. Father claimed the honor of pulling (Red Clouds Nephew) "The Dauntless Young Chief" in the lead as he called him. Both Mother + Dad have passed over a good many years ago. I was born during the later years of Dad's life. Being just twelve yrs<sic>years</sic> when he died in 1908. I wonder if you could give me an idea as to some place to give my (papers &#8212; Letters &#8212; commissions<unclear>)</unclear> to when I should pass on as I want them <unclear>reserved</unclear> and I value them very highly myself no money could buy them. And I would also like to know where I could get a copy of your lovely book as anything about

                    my Father is valuable to me, I think I have said enough. I would appreciate a letter from you very much indeed. Thanking you very much. I Remain</p>
