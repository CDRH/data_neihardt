Dear Mr. Neihardt:
I am currently doing research on the relationship between William Faulkner's Go Down Moses (1942) and Indian history. There seem to be a number of distinct echoes reververating between his long story The Bear which is a part of the longer novel, Go Down, Moses, and Black Elk Speaks which you published originally in 1932.
Would you by any chance have information on whether or not Faulkner may have had knowledge of your work? I would be most grateful to you for any information which you might have. 
I would also like to add my note of thanks for Black Elk Speaks. I now assign it in my American literature classes and find it makes for more careful leading both of itself and the other works on the course than I have ever experienced before.
Thanking you in advance, I am. 
Very sincerely yours,
James D. Brasch.
