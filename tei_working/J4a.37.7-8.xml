Dear Dr. Neihardt:
You probably have received a postal, requesting that a list of your publications be sent me. This compilation of books by Nebraska Writers Guild members is to be reproduced and distributed by the Nebraska Library Commission. 
Each book should include title, copyright date, publisher or printer, if it is paperback, and retail price or if it is out of print.
Thank you for your letter and the Flaming Rainbow for my Christmas gift, ALL IS BUT A BEGINNING, to Mrs. Brown. She was delighted. So was I. I hope to hear from you soon. 
Sincerely yours,
Ruth Crone
