Dear Friends:
I am sure you noticed that the February issue of Saturday Review was not devoted to Dr. Neihardt. I am distressed and unhappy--and SR knows it. I called them and they have rescheduled the piece for the April issue. I am now in the process of drafting a "tough" letter to them speaking of such things as inefficiency, credibility, rude manners and the like. So there: that'll teach 'em.
And I missed your birthday, Gaki. Please accept both my apologies and my congratulations. I hope you celebrated in a moderate fashion and didn't do anything unworthy of your lofty stature in the world of letters! 
Spring is determined to replace winter here in Manhattan. I jut looked at the tree in front of my house and thetulips I planted last fall are up 2" already. The trees themselves have buds. WE are all <del/> holding ourcollective breaths in case a freeze comes and destroys all our efforts. 
I have been busy. I just did a piece for the Sunday TIMES on Marlo Thomas, the actresses who is involved in women's liberation. It was fun. And she is a nice woman. We sat one whole afternoon in the Russian Tea Room drinking--what else--tea and talking. (I was horrified that the tea in such a chic place was from an ordinary old Lipton tea bag. Oh--progress.)
I am involved in a battle that is <del/> brewing out in my home town, Albion. There is a move afoot to tear down the old courthouse--which I happen to love. It is a massive pile of old red brick sitting on a little hillock in the middle of town. I think ti shoudl be preserved. I am in touch with the Nebraska State Historic Society and the National Register of Landmakrs. That ought to shake up the old home town! Wait until I get out on a street corner with leaflets and petitions to sign! 
Well-just wanted you to know about Saturday Review. Cross your collective fingers til April. Hope all is well on Vine Street. 
All my love, 
Katie
