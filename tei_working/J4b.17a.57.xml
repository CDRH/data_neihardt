Darling girlie:
<p>Max's trouble was a bad felon. Daddy took her to Dr Evans who lanced it quickly and efficiently - but it was terribly painful. It was high time that it be lanced so we are so grateful we got Home when we did. Hope our Neihardt boy is swell as well as his mother?! Please write often if only a card. We are having the grass and weeds cut and the place is coming to life again. Wish you could bring your family down soon - Anytime you can we'd love it.</p>
<p>Am starting your dressers today -</p>
Love to all of you
from Mama
