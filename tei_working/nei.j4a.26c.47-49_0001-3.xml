                <p>Today we received your letter to Dad (<hi rend="caps">J.R.</hi> (Bob) Kelly.) So it is my task to advise you of his leaving us, to find his office, in the land of eternal Joy. The week end after your visit he entered the Hospital and was operated on for cancer of the Colon. He was in the Hospital for thirty days and completely recovered from the operation. He came home to us then for ten days. On the 28th of Oct He began to have pain in his chest. The doctor gave him some relief However on the morning of the 29th I was cal<del>ed</del><add>led</add> home, as he was in considerable pain. The doctor said he should be returned to the Hospital. I accompanied him in the ambulance, but he was beyond earthly help. He passed a<del/><add>w</add>ay fiftenn minutes after reaching the Hospital. His heart just ga<del>w</del><add>v</add>e out. The Funeral was held here in Omaha, and was conducted by the Elks Lodge, that was his wish, with burial in the family plot at Bancroft, where my Mother, His father and Sister are also buried.</p>
                
                <p>We here at home want to thank you for your visit with us that evening. <hi rend="underline">God Bless You</hi> for it was the last real enjoyment that he had. You were the last of his old friends with <del/><add>w</add>hom he visited. His passing has left an

                    emptyness<sic>emptiness</sic> in our home that can never be forgotten. It is with tears in my eyes as I w<del/><add>r</add>ite this note, for I think of how even now, when I come home I hang up my coat, and walk in to his room to find him gone, I am so used to doing this that I don't realize he isn't there. The sound of his typewriter and his gentle voice is stilled forever. There is a deep void in our home that will always remain, for he was part of what makes a house a home. If you notice a few tear drops on the lines of this letter, you will excuse them for you knew him for the man he was. Kind, Gentle and unassuming but always there when you needed him.</p>
