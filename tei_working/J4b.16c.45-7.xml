<p>In addition to the Col. Poetry Fellowship dinner, teh Col. Authors League will give us a luncheon, So Mama can wear <underline>all</underline> her clothes, and they're really <underline>right</underline> and beautiful.</p>
<p>Great weather for a try through the high plains!</p>
<p>It's bully that you are now householders! Surely a wise paln. Inflantion will befriend you.</p>
<p>I've been making surprising progress, and am thoroughly happy over the work. Ollie, I predict that you will favor <underline>The Song of Jed Smith</underline>. I can see you reading the book with that pipe in your mouth!</p>
<p>The knife has grown steadily too. The two ways of making flourish together. Golly, what a knife!</p>
Endless love to all <underline>Three</underline>of you,
Dad.
