Branson, Tuesday.
Dear Enot:
<p>The MS reached me yesterday, and the whole thing is starting for New York today. You did a lovely job, and I'm grateful.</p>
<p>We heard happy news of you and Oddie from the kids last Sunday. You were so sweet to them, you two, they said; and you, Enot Peanot, were blooming like a rase under the care of a good gardener! Nanny and I are happy about you, and <underline>with</underline> you.</p>
<p>Macmillans seem to be quite alive. They have the material for the catalog Announcment; the dummy is ready; and they have asked me to suggest a picture for the jacket, which I've done.</p>
<p>A week ago I heard from Calif., and things were going forward.</p>
<p>I should be very happy, bubbling. But I'm so terribly <underline>lonesome</underline>, with</p>
112
<p>a <underline>gone</underline> feeling inside.</p>
<p>We do love you both - rather, <underline>all three</underline>!</p>
<underline>Dad</underline>
