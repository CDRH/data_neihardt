Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Your Christmas greeting was indeed a very rare inspiration. The explanation of your Indian name raised me to the height of the Rainbow.</p>
<p>Here is my salutation to you:

<lg><l>Your poetry God's witness is,</l>
<l>Your lines are living words of His,</l>
<l>Your spirit of the cosmic flame</l>
<l>That He sealed with the "Naihardt Name."</l></lg></p>
<p>May I wish to you and yours a most happy and prosperous New Year.</p>
Very sincerely yours,
<signed>Milford E. Shields</signed>
