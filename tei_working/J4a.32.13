Mr. John G. Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska
Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>I have a copy of a letter written by Dr. Parker on March 12 mentioning the ceremony we have planned on April 20 in connection with the Friends of the Library. Now, further to Dr. Parker's letter we would like to honor you at the same time with a dedication ceremony of the Neihardt Colleciton and the bust, which we have just mounted. We would like to hold this ceremony in the library following our annual Friends meeting in the afternoon of Saturday, April 20. At this same time we will also be pre-sention Mr. Knipmeyer with an honorarium for his work on the <p>collection.</p>
Since we wish to get started with publicity, I would like to know if you would be able to be here with us in Columbia on the date mentioned? Perhaps when you receive this letter you would be kind enought to call me collect here in the library and let me know your thoughts on this matter. Very best wishes to you. I will be looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Donald C. Dickinson</signed>
