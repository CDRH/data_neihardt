Precious Mona:
<p>Your letter came at breakfast this morning. Sig will arrive this evening and we'll stay here all night. I can't know when I can get away tomorrow, but I hope it may be early. They can keep me, according to contract, if they want me.</p>
<p>I gave the talk on Lit Since 1912 yesterday P.M., and I did <underline>not</underline> pull any punches or pussfoot in the least. I think most of the audience was with me. Dr. Beauchamp, my chairman, &amp; the best educated man here, probably, said he only wished the whole student body had been</p>

<p>present. I may not have made a thoroughly finished speech of it, but I think I did drive it hoome. And, O my God! how institutions of learning <underline>do</underline> need it. According to the best progs here, the youngsters don't really want to be educated; and yet Knox students are a picked &amp; limited group. Profs. have told me of their sorrows, and it has been a revelation to me. Yet the kids are <underline>dear</underline> and essentially - or at least potentially - fine.</p>
<p>It's a dark time, surely. But so <underline>many</underline> fine people are aware of the fact. So many people are <underline>good</underline>. No more now.</p>
Endless love to you and the precious girls.
Jno.
