                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>For some time now, I have wanted to tell you how much I appreciated having you as an instructor and a friend at the University of Missouri. Since this is my last semester, perhaps this is the time to express my feeling.</p>
                
                <p>It was in your Critical Essay class that I learned to know you. After the course was over, I realized that a skillful hand had helped my writing. Although your precise, yet meaningful, knowledge of writing gave me a new outlook in the written word, I feel the thoughts you expressed gave me the most aid.</p>
                
                <p>Actually, the University and University professors had begun to look like a narrow minded lot to me. But in you I found a man that was capable of finding some-thing good in everyone. Here was a man that accepted every religion as how own and treated each one with its due respect. I began to realize that part of your message was that every man has a good spot and the people that refuse to realize this usually <del/><add>ar</add>e unhappy ones.</p>
                
                <p>It seemed that you said <del>that you said</del><add>in your class</add> so many things that I had always wanted to say. Things that I thought before and things that I had heard before suddenly rang clear. The reason--here was a man who actually thought this way, a man who lived this way. It made me feel that the good in a man was what you saw and the bad was only what you made yourself see.</p>
                
                <p>In this small letter, I have only made a dent in my feelings towards you. Perhaps I have taken a course in college that will provide me with more money making ability in later years. But no association in my college career will ever bring me more understanding and self-satisfacti<del>n</del><add>o</add>n then my association with you.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Thank you,</salute>
