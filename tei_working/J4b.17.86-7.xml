Darling Enid Girlies and Ollie!
<p>Your dear face, Enid is before me, and the quiet expression it held at the last, as you waved from the front door of your sweet home.</p>
<p>We cannot plan very far ahead and so we must trust that the Future needs will be taken care of as they come. Every time I say goodbuy to one of you dear children I feel <underline>I am dying</underline>, and the very thought of death is <underline>wrong</underline>. Somehow you and I can <underline>never</underline> be parted. Let us Keep this in our minds and may be the nightmare</p>

<p>will vanish.</p>
<p>I am so glad I could be with you darling, and see how much of good you have in your life. Ollie is such a dear good man and deserves all the love you give him. Together you will soon have a wonderful baby that you will join in caring for, and that makes everything perfect for you both. Thanks for all yoru Kindnesses to Daddy and me while we stayed there with you.</p>
<p>As we appreciated our gate, there was a long row of eager golden jonquil faces turned to welcome us. What a lovely surprise! The Japonica is rose red too, the hedge is greening and the grass is too.</p>
<p>Baby 'Laine has been happy every minute and it is good to have her with us. The place is dear, and after all there is no place like Home.</p>
<p>Mrs Cantwell is so glad to have us back and everything has been taken careof.</p>
<p>This is all for to day, except that I am eager to hear from you.</p>
Always your devoted
Mama-Mother.
