Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Thank you very much for your friendly letter of the 21st.</p>
<p>To me it is a "solid inspiration" to know thay you are now "assembling" your autobiography. Posterity must know "the <underline>makings</underline> of the man and of the poet." They need the solid rock on which to stand. Poetry looks up to you.</p>
<p>Here is a short poem which came to me last night:</p>
DIFFERENT
<lg><l>Each sunrise is a burst of colors bright,</l>
<l>Each on a different design of light;</l>
<l>Each smile is as a burst of beaming light,</l>
<l>Each one as different as colors bright.</l>
<l>I shall read it to the Rainbow girls tonight.</l></lg>
<p>And here is my fourteenth annual to the Colorado Legislature:</p>
THE FINEST CODE
<lg><l>In this mad world of storm and strife</l>
<l>We are a mystic island State;</l>
<l>Our Colorado way of life</l>
<l>Becomes a bulwark strong and great.</l>

<l>Our laws are like our mountains high,</l>
<l>Our ethics as our own rich soil,</l>
<l>Solutions men may pattern by</l>
<l>To turn this world to peaceful toil.</l>

<l>In truth and fairness you become</l>
<l>Good Legislators to the world </l>
<l>As you keep Colorado's sum</l>
<l>Of laws the finest code unfurled.</l></lg>

Very sincerely,
