Dear Lucile:

	Three nights ago I saw you in a dream and you seemed to be sick. Your face had a grayish look as though you were very weary, and you were dark about the eyes. I'm afraid now that you really are sick, so I'm writing to say I'm thinking about you. Still, I'm hoping that the dream was not "veridical", and that you are only very busy.
	I'm  judging a poetry

contest for the Poetry Society of Texas, and the stuff must be returned today. I've been their judge several times before, and always the poetry offered was better than I expected. Some was very fine. But this time I'm judging for only 
<hi rend="underline">one</hi> of <hi rend="underline">various</hi> prizes, and I'm sure I have not the best offerings of the contest. My poetry class does far better stuff on the average. (I have two boys who can write poetry; with faults, of course!) There's only one really authentic thing in the Texas stuff. It's short, and it is

entitled <hi rend="underline">Nobody Gathers Grapes Here Anymore</hi>. There is one on the battle of San Jacinto that is almost good enough.
	Oh, Lucile, don't be sick!
	I've thought of our Bancroft trip a lot. You remember I drew your attention to the old Post Office, don't you? 
<hi rend="underline">That</hi> used to be, and was for years, the most important place in my life. I lived on the mail, and I was always there, ahead of time,

waiting for the mail to be distributed. My god! The heartaches I had in that building! <hi rend="underline">Waiting, waiting - and then disappointment</hi>! <hi rend="underline">And</hi> there were times of joyful triumph too. Generally, after the two Wubs could walk, I had them with me, regardless of the weather. Even in blizzard weather they went along. O I wish we could dream back the old days in Bancroft &amp; Wayne together!! There is <hi rend="underline">so</hi> much to remember.
	Please don't be <hi rend="underline">very</hi> sick, Lucile!
