HOTEL FORT DES MOINES 
DES MOINES, IOWA
Friday Morning 8:30

Dear Mona and Girls:
<p>The affair has been going off ver pleasantly here, and my speech last night was the best so far. I've been talking entirely off-hand, reading nothing - and it works. The manager of all the Forums, who goes with me from place to place, is certainly happy about it. I've talked three or four times outside the Forums with most pleasant results. My last affair is tonight; but Saturday noon I'll be a luncheon with the City Poetry Club. I've refused nothing, and been a good guy.</p>
<p>Happy as I feel about my contacts with groups + crowds, there is, just the same, something mildly ludicrous about throwing so much vitality &amp; the results of so many years at people.</p>

<p>I wonder if, after all, most of the effect is not hypnotic. I wonder if it would make much difference, what I might say. Isn't it something that comes out of me, holds and moves them, and then leaves them wondering what it was all about. In many cases there must be much more; but, in the main, I wonder. It <underline>is</underline> true, though, that I always feel warm affection for the people sitting there. And they feel so in return, it seems - most of them anyway. Maybe <underline>that</underline> is the real event.</p>
<p>I do hope old lady Alice is feeling reassured now. Things will be fine for her. And how about the cageful of nightingales?</p>
Endless love to see of you.
Jno Dad
