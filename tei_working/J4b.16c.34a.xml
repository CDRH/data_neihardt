Dear Dad:
<p>Thanks so much for the good letters recieved from you &amp; from Mama too. It means a lot to me to hear often.</p>
<p>Time flies by so fast that I don't write nearly as often as I should. Conscription has made a great change in peoples attitudes in many ways. Business at times is very pitiful &amp; slow.</p>
<p>Jos. Deutschmann &amp; Bob Walther (at our store) plan on being drafted, since they are both eligible. So, if nothing happens to change this, we'll have still more changes at our store.</p>
<p>Hilda &amp; I could do wonders together if we could practice daily. Perhaps some new job or something will give me sensible working hours &amp; make possible such a set-up as daily work with Hilda. I'm thrilled to hear how well you are doing with Jed, also to know of Macmillan's plan for the 1-Volume-edition of the Cycle. I feel confident that much better things will happen when this Cycle is finished.</p>
<p>I wish you folks would not worry so much, or at all, if you can keep from it. If necessary - Hil &amp; I could borrow the money to save that home. Anyway, there will be <underline>lectures</underline>, also other</p>
over
-2-
<p>sources of money before the critical time comes around.</p>
<p>I want to see you so much, also to see Mama.</p>
<p>Must stop for now.</p>
<p>Max &amp; I are at work on that Penna. state list of institutions, &amp; using recent comment from Lock Haven &amp; Shippensburg.</p>
<p>Please take care of yourselves.</p>
Endless love,
Sig &amp; all.
