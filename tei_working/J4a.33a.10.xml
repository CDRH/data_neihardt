Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I am greatly enjoying your <underline>Cycle of the West</underline>. I am surely proud to know the author of this great work as well as I do, and with time I will improve the acquaintance I hope.</p>
<p>How is your present undertaking progressing? I hope it is keeping you both healthy and happy.</p>
<p>I have a little exchange with Tom, some of it through our mutual friend, Mr. William Edward Cox, who visited Missouri recently and made contact with Tom and Joe.</p>
<p>The summer is a busy time for us. People are coming in now for the Meeting that will take place at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>
Sincerely yours,
