Wednesday Morning. [Apr 9, 1930]
Dear Mamma: 
I was hoping to hear from you this morning, and maybe I'll get a letter yet. Last night Mona and I were talking about you and wondering if you are really fairly happy to be in Branson. She said, "Daddy, you must write her and say that if she wants to come back awhile she must just say so, and we'll be glad to have her": And we would be glad. I'm wondering if the weather is as queer it looks as though there might be snow. Has your paper started to come regularly yet? I don't see how they got mixed up that way. How soon will you have the change from 25 cycle to 60 cycle current ? Your ten dollars would just about get an eliminator for $# 60 cycle current, and, anyway, we want you to have the radio working. Sig looked around, and has been threatening to write you, but he has been working nearly all his spare time on the Gardner, which he has put in really fine shape. There is so little to say. Things go on steadily the same. Sig is doing excellent work in school and Enid is getting on finely. The little kids are happy and Mona is just getting over another headache, but she is reasonably happy too. 
We all love you - of that you can be sure. 
Jno.
