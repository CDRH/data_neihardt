                    <salute>Dear John,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>The first test pressings arrived and the quality was excellent but they forgot to make them with s<del>pe</del><add>ep</add>arations between the sections so I am having them cut <del>them</del> over again. I will send you a copy as soon as they finish the second cut. I am now w<del>i</del><add>a</add>iting for Bill to make up his mind what he wants to do so I will know what to put on the album, Artists Recording Studios, or Orpheus Records. Everything else is ready to <del>t</del><add>g</add>o and once I give the various compan<del>y</del><add>i</add>es concerned the go ahead the records will be done withing<sic>within</sic> two weeks. This means that we can still have them done by the middle of March.</p>
                
                <p>Bill w<del>or</del><add>r</add>ote and said that he would be interested in a one third interest if we send out a mailer first. This would delay things at least two months and probably longer so I told him that I planned to go ahead with <add>them</add> now since I already had quite a bit tied up in them. I am waiting for the rep<del>y</del><add>l</add>y to this letter now; I imagine (and hope) that he will not be inte<del>4</del><add>r</add>ested.</p>
                
                <p>By the way, the first paragraph of the material for the back of the al<del>m</del><add>b</add>um reads as follows: Gone practically without trace but for motto-stamped relics, Hollywood pipe-dreams, and lists of dates and names in history books, is the frontier spirit that carved this nation from a raw continent. The frontier era covered the greater part of the whiteman's span in America; this was the period <del>w</del><add>o</add>f his greatest vitality, and it has left permanent and pervasive marks on the national character -- yet it has only been in recent years that men capable of chronicaling the spirit of that time for posterity have turned to it for subject and inspiration. The his<del>o</del><add>t</add>orian can arragne<sic>arrange</sic> and label the fossil facts; only the writer of imaginative literature can show "the very age and body of the time is<note><figure><figDesc>"is" circled and linked to a ?</figDesc></figure></note> form and pressure."</p>
                
                <p>In Ockie's original copy the last quote (I imagine it is from one of your prefaces and I don't have the mate<del>i</del><add>r</add>ial here to check it) read<add>s</add> thus: "the very age and body of the time his<note><figure><figDesc>"his" circled and linked to a ?</figDesc></figure></note> form and pressure." I changed the 'his' to an 'is.' Is this correc<del><unclear>6</unclear></del><add>t</add>? Or is it supposed to be 'has'?</p>
                
                <fw type="curatorial">46</fw>
                
                <p>I just read your <hi rend="underline">The River and I</hi>. It is quite exciting and I am eager to hop in a boat and start coasting, or pulling or pushing as the case may be. I think the film i<del>ad</del><add>de</add>a has a good chance of selling and I think it would be an exciting thing to film. The script I mentioned in my last letter doesn't have to be anything more than a rough word picture of the various points of interest along the way.</p>
                
                <p>Does this suddent burst of enthusiasm surprise you? It shouldn't since you are responsible for it. As I said once before, I have gained much from our friendship, but I think the most valuable thing you helped me recapture was my enthusia<del>m</del><add>s</add>m and eagerness for life. A professor I have out here said in class the other day that<del>y</del>you only fail when you stop trying. And until I met you I <hi rend="underline">had</hi> become a failure be<del/><add>c</add>ause I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> stop trying. But I'm done with that attitu<del>e</del><add>d</add>e!</p>
                
                <p>I am encolsing<sic>enclosing</sic> one of the photographs I took at your place before I left Columbia. This is not a very good print but the negative is cabable<sic>capable</sic> of a good print. What do you think of using it for the cover of one of the future albums. Do you like enough for that purpose? I don't have an extra print <del>for the</del><add>of the</add> one I'm using for this album but I think you will like it. It is the one I took through the door of you in your library.</p>
