poets, I fancy, are queerer still. Don't stew, old man.

Thanks for the poem - a curious, moody thing, and beautiful, of course.

I'll write </unclear> on the 10th, as you suggest. Very glad for the chance to know him.
    
When you go on that world - though, don't forget me. Come this way, if possible.

I want to make a confession + ask a favor. The confession: I gave away my copy of that terrific sonnet, "The Theriot of Satan". A friend, to whom I was deeply indebted, asked for it. A copy wouldn't do. The favor: won't you write me out another + send it?
