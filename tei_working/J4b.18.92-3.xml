Dearest Ollie and Enid:
<p>You dear wonderful people! Thank you <underline>so</underline> much for all your dear concern.</p>
<p>Please find out for me too if Hilda has recovered from her sickness due to overheating, will you? Maxie mentioned it and I have not heard from Hilda at all about it. I'll be so grateful Enid if you will do this.</p>
<p>Next I have a favor to ask of you Ollie! Will you please get me as many pictures of General MacArthur as you can? I have been given an idea that might make some money, and I am very eager to follow it up. Please don't speak about this, as it is not any thing more than an idea as yet, but I do need all the views I can get of Gen MacArthur. May be you could</p>

<p><unclear/> some old newspapers or magazines articles with his pictures, or may be you can tell <underline>me</underline> how I can go about it to get them?</p>
<p>I am canning peaches without sugar today. May be we will all be using them together next Winter!</p>
<p>Amama has just finished the Knitted set for baby Nei! It is adorable!</p>
<p>Kiss and hug my big boy from his Nanny who loves him a lot! I was so glad Max and the Wubs were out to see you!</p>
Loads of love always - and there is no news -
from Mama - Mother.
