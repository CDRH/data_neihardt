Son <unclear/>, C. S. 
Mr. John G. Neihardt.
Bancroft Nebr. 
Dear Son: yours of the 1st <unclear/>, and a most welcome message, reached here on the 16th inst.
Though ,dear Son, may of mention, that this very kind letter of yours might have been a little more lengthy, by a line or two in reference to your Dear and most estimable Sisters, form whom I have not heard for many months

In regard to your contemplated tour, and as regards fare by sail, ship, stage <unclear/>, am not at this writing able to inform you; I shall however collect all the necessary infor-mation in my power as speedily as possible. I have written to the Manila Times, and to-day also <unclear/>, Smith Bell v Co.-Manila sets of Canadian Pacific Railway <unclear/> Royal Mail Steem ShipLine. At present (as you are aware) it would be extremly dangerous to travel in the Chinese Empire as there is a cruel butchery carried on by the Boxers"

<unclear/> in a year or two, affairs will be different in that part of The Orient. Though by water from Hong Kong to Singa-pore thence to Colombo, thence to <unclear/> is and shall continue to be, a very pleasurable rout. I fear that I shall not be able to accompany you, in their contemplated trip, as my salary is small, and my ravings scant. However it would be of unspeakable pleasure; as the comrades say: "a constant round of pleasure." 
I am so filled with awe, and wonder, to <del/> learn of your wonderful stride in education, and your Literary work, that 

12
know scarcely what to think or write; I can think of you only as little Tommie when playing, and feeding teh <unclear/> Owl, and I can see the long string which you had fastened to its leg and too, think of the Cable-line that you built, the grip that your Inventive Genius built invented, and we get remember the Raccoon and its <unclear/>,-bit rather hard at times, I <unclear/>. Can you remember of the derrick which you built in the brick store at Springfield Illis.,?

It is 1.30 p.m. for dinner we had sweet potatos, breakfast bacon, coffee, (american) gravy, and excell-ent bread very fine indeed looked up the river at Canada about twelve miles from here. We have been getting bread from Manila until recently The Rainy Season has begun; when we came to this town, the natives were gathering a crop of corn to day I can see from in the Convent another crop growing on the same ground, and the corn seems to be five or more feet tall. Rain has been falling for about three days, but we need not worry so long as we remain in these quarters, the Convent.

two Regiments have been ordered to China near Peking, I shoudl like to have gone there. We may be called or ordered there yet. Hong Kong is about <del/> Six Hundred Forty miles from Manila. 
I have been to the City twice since we came to San Lewis, our pass calls for three days leave of absence. Manila is improving I visited the tomb and obelisk of The Great Magellan, who was the first European (accent on 3rd syllable) to set foot upon the soil of the Arcipellago, he arrived at <unclear/> on Mindanao (mindanow) on the 31st day of March 1521. From thence he went to <unclear/> where the King with 800 others were baptized and swore allegience to the Spanish King

the intrepid navigator met this death at their hands on the 26th day of April 1521. His monument stands on the left bank of the Pasig river; just outside of the walls, of manila. 
Gomez Das-marinas (1590) by him were built the <unclear/> of Manila which to-day, although covered with moss, are still in a good state of preservation, and with their parapets, moats and ponderous gates and draw bridges, constitute a most curious relic of the Middle Ages. 
In the year 1641 was one of serious and volcanic actions and disturbances in these <unclear/>. Terrestrial shocks were felt

The Earth rocked and plunged, trees and church spires swung to and fro, like the masts of a ship in a storm; heavy timbers were smashed like reeds, walls tumbled down, and the heavy tiled roofs buried beneath their swims over 600 victims the shocks continued to be felt for two days. During the following months vice regal decrees were issued from beneath the shade of palm - trees. In adjacent places whole towns perished and mountains were <unclear/>.

The steamer "Cleveland passes up this river in the Eve and down so far as <unclear/> which is on the R. R. 14 miles distant; this boat is about 40 ft. long and to it are attached or fastened, Cas-cos, one two and sometimes three which are as long and nearly as broad as the Cleveland:" There is also a <unclear/>-boat. "Napindan" flying on this the Rio Grande. Have you received the <unclear/> which I sent ? My regards to Sisters N. N. Neihardt. Co. L. 22nd <unclear/> Philippines.
