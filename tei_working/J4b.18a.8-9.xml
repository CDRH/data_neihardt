Dearest Daddy!
<p>I just came home, to find an envelope addressed by you and containing the wonderfully beautiful "For Albert and Hilda". I cannot say how moved I am by both the beautiful lyric and your having written it for us. I am saving it for Albert to see before I let anyone else read it. When Albert arrives, I shall read it to him, and his appreciation will be as great as mine.</p>
<p>daddy, our own endlessly dear and wonderful Daddy, we thank you for this great gift that we shall treasure always.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will write it in indelible ink on a vellum sheet, to be the first page of Our Book -.</p>
<p>this poem, made for us, has already given me a new "lift", and it will be a source of inspiration and help to Albert and me in the years to come. I never before appreciated</p>

<p>anything in just the way I appreciate this gift of yours. It was such a surprise, comign so suddenly and having such special meaning. It can hardly wait for Albert's return!</p>
Loving you endlessly,
Hilda and Albert
