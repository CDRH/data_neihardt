Dearest Enid:
<p>Your good letter was so welcome. We are delighted you are so well and busy. Maxie has been washing woodwork and placing flowers about the <strike>place</strike> rooms making things beautiful. She surely has the gift! I have been lazy for several days! The Wisteria that blooms so early, tell Ollie, is the <underline>Chinese blue</underline>. We have it, and the <underline>ordinary</underline> Kind too <strike/> which is now leafing out, and will bloom in a week or so. Yours is the Chinese blue, will not bloom till well established!</p>
Love always Mama
