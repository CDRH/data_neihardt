Dear Lucile:

	<p>It has just occurred to me that I should tell you something important before I forget it. Here it is: You should read Egan Freidel's <hi rend="underline">Cultural History of the Modern Age</hi>. I've thought of this often, but never remembered it at the right time. You need not read more than Volume II - the first three chapters thereof especially. This will give you a background of strong historical

-2-

support for the main thesis of my critical writing from 1912 to 1936. It's about <hi rend="underline">time moods</hi>. When I was writing I had not seen the work. It is not that my thesis is like Freidel's but that his historical discussion 
<hi rend="underline">supports my argument</hi>. His work was translated from the German in 1931 (You know, of course, I am thinking of my attitude toward the present time-mood and my explanation of it - often sketched in my article.)

I hope everything is going well with you'ns, and I feel it is so. I'm planning the trip for July. Will write Bower soon.</p>

	<p>The Uni. of Neb. Press offers me a contract for republication of <hi rend="underline">Black Elk Speaks</hi> ("a great book", "a very beautiful book") in a "quality paper" edition. I accepted, but the contracts stipulate that I shall furnish <hi rend="underline">three copies of the original edition</hi>! I have no three copies to give, and you know how difficult they are to get. I don't know what will be done.</p>
