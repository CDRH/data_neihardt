Dear Mr. Neihardt:
The South Dakota Bicentennial Commission has been requested to contact you about the possibility of building a pageant around your book BLACK ELK SPEAKS, to be performed during 1976 to honor the Sioux Indian heri-tage of South Dakota. 
The Commission feels that your permission for utilizing the verbal com-ments recorded in BLACK ELK SPEAKS is necessary before we encourage our proponents to do anything more with the idea. In the event that you approve of the idea, a young Indian writer has offered his services to us to work up the pageant. 
The pageant contemplated would not be a money-making venture. We would look on this as a vital part of South Dakota's bicentennial celebration, and not as a commercial enterprise. 
Would you apprise us of your feelings on the merits of this idea, and whether or not  you would approve such use of BLACK ELK SPEAKS? If you would like more detailed information about the proposal, we will provide what we have. 
Sincerely,
Mark A. Young
