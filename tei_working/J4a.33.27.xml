Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>As I told you following the luncheon of the Nebraska Writers' Guild at Hastings recently, it was, as always, a delightful and inspiring experience to hear you. I believe I first heard you speak and read your poetry when I was fifteen--close to forty-five years ago; then, and each time I have heard you since, it has been a most rewarding experience. So, of course, has been the reading and teaching of your poetry over the years.</p>
<p>You suggested that we might exchange one of your books (I have all of yours, thanks), so I am sending you <underline>The Silent Storm</underline>, a book I wrote in collaboration with Ruth Crone. Although it was written for young readers, my editor says it is "for young people from nine to ninety," so you qualify. I hope you will enjoy it.</p>
<p>I have published ten books, and number eleven, <underline>The Many Faces of Willa Cather</underline> is in production at Scribner's. This is biographical in lnature and is for an adult audience.</p>
<p>Since visiting with you briefly two weeks ago, I have been wondering whether or not you have anyone working on a biography of John G. Neihardt? If not, I should certainly like to talk to you about doing it. I can think of no writing pro-ject to which I could turn with more enthusiasm.</p>
Sincerely yours,
<signed>Marion March Brown</signed>
(Mrs. Gilbert S. Brown)
