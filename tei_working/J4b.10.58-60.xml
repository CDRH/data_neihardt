Aug 23rd, 1934
My dear Dr House:
John has just todl me that it does not seem right for me to ask so much money for my work on his monument. Also he is afriad it may em-barass you. 
Now that he has stated it all so clearly I see too that the whole thing looks wrong. 
I want therefore to ask you to please drop the matter, temporarily at least. 
Besides the above, I am suffering with severe headaches which I should outgrow in the 

59
course of a few years. Then may be the time will be ripe for your plan. In the meanwhile I hope you have not lost sleep over the affair. We will always deeply appreciate your wonder-ful interest in John and his work. 
With kindest thoughts 
Mona Neihardt.
