My dear Mr. Neihardt/
I have just re read your review of my "Learning and other essays" in the Sunday Times. I knew from your letter that the review be favorable; but I was not prepared for such a blast, nor have I ever had anything like it. By some likeness of inner history the essays mean to you what I meant them to say. But what a wonderful coincidence that this man should be chosen to review the volume! And how much more am I getting than any man has a right to expect in the way ^of what he thinks is understanding of his work. Thank you - or rather thank God for the conjunction
Your friend
John Jay Chapman
