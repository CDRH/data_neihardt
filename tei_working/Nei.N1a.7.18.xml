My dear Dr. Neihardt,
God gave us memory that we might have roses in December-so says the poet - and now I know you will not mind the "rocking chair" days if ever they come to you. - all of which means I've just read "The River an I: 

In fact I came up stairs with the dawn to finish it - began last evening - thank you -
Three of my mother's brothers and one of my Father's went west to Montana as youngsters -

We often visited there - Once when draught came Uncle Joe with camp outfit  and
family including Missouri relatives drove the stock from Musselshell to near Canadian border
- Once he shipped near train load of horses to Missouri Market- 

Then my grad Norweigan husband grew up just east of Devil's Lake N. D- you go to the farm -
and the brother-in-law drives us over "townships."

So I lived <unclear/> from Fort Benton. For once I taught in high school. 30 miles from the
Fort a few years ago we stayed in the old hotel - not much changed-

But best of all - was just you in the book. Thank you - do come back to Branson often - we so
enjoyed you at the Library Club and the daughters, too. 

Sincerely
Jewell Ross Mehus
(Mr. D. Myking Mehus.)
