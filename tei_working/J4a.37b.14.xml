Dear Dr. Neihardt:
As you know the University of Nebraska Board of Regents has approved a proposal to re-name Women's Residence Halls, a residence on the UNL campus, the John G. Neihardt Residential Center.
The students and staff of this residence hall are planning a Dedication Ceremony to be held in October and we would be highly honored if you would consent to be present. The date has been tentatively set for Sunday, October 21, at 3:00pm. Your presence, Dr. Neihardt, would make this a most meaningful and memorable occasion. 
If it is possible for you to attend we hope you would consider taking a few moments to recite a selection of poetry. The date for the ceremony is not final and we would be more than happy to schedule the ceremony on a day that is more convenient for you. 
The students at the University of Nebraska have a great deal of respect for  you and your accomplishments. We sincerely wish you can be with us and share the dedication of the John G. Neihardt Residential Center. 
We will be anxiously awaiting a reply from you, Dr. Neihardt.
Sincerely,
Georgia Glass
