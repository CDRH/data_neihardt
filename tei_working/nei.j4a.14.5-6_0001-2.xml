                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Please do not think that I am the most ungrateful person between the two oceans even although I have let more than a month go by without acknowledging the beautiful gift of your collected poems. I could, of course, have acknowledged it at once, e<del/><add>x</add>pressing my pleasure and pride and saying I should read every word in the two volumes and knew that I should delight in the reading, but I wanted to actually do it, and expected, of course, to finish the reading much earlier. But Christmas came blustering along, and then there was illness, so that it was only last night that I achieved the last page in the second volume. I had not really intended to read the second volume at this time because my earlier copies of "The Song of Hugh Glass," and "The Song of the Indian Wars," as well as my copy of"The Song of the Three Friends," and "The Stranger at the Gate" had been read more than once and are thoroughly marked in evidence thereof. But I had not known "A Bundle of Myrrh," nor "A Vision of Woman," and having once become started on these I could not stop, but reread everything that I had

                    known before and dwelt with special admiration on "Two Mothers," which came to me quite by surprise. But fine as the lyrics are, often so subtly significant and moving, your peculiar power is certainly manifest in these "Epics of the West," a genuine and great gift to our America. I am rejoiced to know that they have gone into our public schools, and can hardly bear to wait for the concluding poems of the cycle. And yet<del>,</del> I have a very deep respect for your attitude toward poetry and toward life and for your fortitude in putting by <add>the</add><del>your</del> fullfilment of your splendid poem until you have achieved your full duty as a father.</p>
                    
                <p>You know perhaps that I had a charming letter from your boy Sigurd, and I am sure that he, as well as the other children, will justify the sacrifice. I trust with all my heart, nevertheless, that the sacrifice means only delay, and that the time is not far distant when your imagination will be in full exercise<del>,</del> again, building up this heroic structure of American history. I shall prize these volumes as long as I live and then pass them on to the college.</p>

                    <salute>Most sincerely and gratefully yours,</salute>
