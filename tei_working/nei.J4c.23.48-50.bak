<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>I did not get it all said in my letter yesterday. <hi rend="underline">I never do</hi>, for that matter. First, I am glad about the Review and the Neihardt program you have been asked to give. I know how fine they will be, and how I wish I could hear them! Then, I'm moved by what you tell me of Mrs. Skillings. How dear of her to want to do something for John's old pal! Yes, I'll be properly <hi rend="underline">surprised</hi>! But before you told me, I was thinking about that bare hom with so much trouble in it, and no light ahead, except the

religious light, which I'm sure Mrs. S. has. I was thinking about this with a little heartache and wondering what I could do; if in any way I could slip a little money into the family purse without giving offence - or better still -without their knowing where it came from. Maybe I could try to buy that fine piece of work she showed us - at a premium price. I 
<hi rend="underline">do</hi> love beautiful needle work<sic>needlework</sic> and skilful<sic>skillful</sic> patient hands.
But what could I offer? How could I go at this business? Can you suggest a way? I wish I could buy the afghan at a 
<hi rend="underline">really good</hi> price; but that couldn't be done under the circumstances.</p>

						<p>Always</p>

	<p>This was written at the University yesterday, and just now I have the good news from you that Bower came home on Wednesday. Hello, Bower! I'm so glad you are at large again, and I can see you sitting in that parlor, happy to be with Lucile and Stewart. I just came too soon; but better too soon than never!

Yes, Lucile, I am happy about the program you will give, and the plan is a good one. I <hi rend="underline">wish/hi> I could be in your audience. Maybe some day I shall be (So the "nice old gentleman" who clipped your hedges thought you were "a nice lady". That makes two of us, and it's unanimous. But it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> gracious of you to feed the "college boy", as well as pay him! Many thanks for your work on the lawn and patio of my "second home". I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I'll bet it's beautiful there. Soon my granddaughter, Nina, will be running our power mower again. She is my standby - very conscientious.</p>
	<p>Yo-Yo went with Hilda to a B &amp; W meeting lately, and was a perfect lady. The President had "the evening's guest" introduced to the other ladies! No more room! Bless the three of you together!</p> <signature>John</signature>
