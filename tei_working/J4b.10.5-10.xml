My own two dear, dear Ones! 
You have been gone a longtime it seems I wonder just how cold you have been? I hope not serious-ly so. 
On account of P.TA convention everything in Branson is upset. No school for Alice on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday! She is delighted - we had Maxine and Patty here to dinner yesterday noon. so both Sigurd and Alice had a nice time. I have the carpets back in the house and another washing done. Am baking for the first time since you left.

I paid the dry goods and grocery hill which was $9.80 for the last week you were home. The Light bill you handed me^to pay John dear, was Grandmas' (=$1.75) ours was $2.35, and the water was $3.50. I paid both; then I sent Hilda $7.50 flus Special Del. stamp and money order. Mr Eiserman had taken the $4.65 C.O. D. out of the $25.00 he was supposed to put back in the Savings Account, and so I told him to give me the remaining $20.35, which will more than run us and pay up what may come in in the way of bills - I know of none save the Tele-phone. I already told you that I depicted the $50.00 (in my name)

the Bank, and think I'll not leave to draw on it at all before you get back, when I can return it to you and you can put it in the Postel Savings with the rest of the money you may have. Mr Eiser-man say sit takes so much of his time to take out or put back small ammounts, 3 hours he said, everytime!! 
Bol Thornbill asked for books to sell during convention. I told him I would bet him have some, but he is to return to me what he does not sell as I am responsible to you. He agreed to this. So I sent down all the worst looking trash from the back

the room. (Not any of there you are still to review) There were 87 in all. 
Hilda called up by phone right soon after you left up there - She said she was not home sick. So we did not get here this weekend. We are planning to go after her Friday noon. I can hardly wait ot see her again. Sunday Sig. is supposed to play over the Radio in Springfield. I do hope things will work out for him The little Ford idles like a big expensive car and it is the sweetest car I ever was in. I am hanging on to your money for all our sakes - Please dont think I am spending any more than necessary. I am not going to paint anything

ther because this is not good drying weather. I had Mr Powel test my eyes for glasses - and that is out of the question now - He wants $8.50 for close ups to say nothing of what he woudl take for "byvocals". 
So I am going to find a pair at the dime store for close up work. The ones I have are just fine for general use. 
Loads of love to you two - always I am thinking of you and Hidla and wishing you the best possible - 
Your Girl - Mamma.
