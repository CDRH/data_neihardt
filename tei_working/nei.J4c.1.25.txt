<p>Thanks, thanks, dear Davis, for
sending me the "map" of the Little
Buffalo. And you were very
kind to mention my mother.
Last night I received a copy of 
the "Bundle" by mail. Stunning
getup! You'll like it! This
first copy, of course, goes to my
mother. But I will have
others soon, and then you get
yours.
I've got a mighty warm place in
my heart for Davis.</p>
	<p>Yours,</p>
