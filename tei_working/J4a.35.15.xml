Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>It was so good of you to send the record, which I shall value and enjoy--while recalling the occasions on which I have been fortunate enough to hear you reading your work in person.</p>
<p>Thank you, too, for your January 11 note, which I apologize for not answering sooner. Needless to say, both Bernice and I have spoken many times of that memorable evening with you and Mr. and Mrs. Young, and we are hoping that it can be repeated, once winter is over.</p>
<p>The BLACK ELK "explosion" rejoices all our hearts. I was looking at the sales record recently and I noticed that the sales for the fiscal year exceeded the total sales for all the seven years from the time we first published the book up to 1968. For the next year the sales were double that of the biggest preceding year; and this last year they jumped to over fifteen thousand. Let's hope the same kind of lightning strikes some more titles in the Neihardt canon.</p>
<p>You asked about Professor Aly's biography. We sent her a lengthy critique from the outside reader some time back, and I assume she is working on revisions.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing your forthcoming television program.</p>
Yours ever,
Virginia Faulkner
