Dearest Enid: 
Of course you may have your little Violin of long ago - and will you let me use it for Elaine later when Fritz is through with it - which will not be soon. I'll surely bring it up or send it by the very next chance. I am delighted your Fritz is starting and this is the right age for him to do so - Ollie will hav eto do somethign to the bow - may be new hairs, also I'd advise the German chin rest - if it hasn't one already - I have forgotten - I don't dare send it by Express and yet I don't know why not, if 

you wish me to - I can value it at $50.00 27 and then you could duplicate it if it were hurt - tell me what you wish - 
I have wanted Crab apples so this year - and have been putting them up. You should have a stamper to do your washings with Enid - I'll bring mine up for you. We do not use it as we are buying a machine. 
I am planning two yellow and white tulip quilts for our guest room - lots of fun - Darling girl you are so sweet to plan for Thanks giving with you - and we will sure ly come if Daddy agrees - The other girls want me to sleep at their place and may be I can?

Maxi was teasing Ollie when she sent Joanie's picture to him, knowing how much he liked Elaine!!-
Daddy writes so happily and enthusiastically about his trip and Sig's playing and the audiences - it is lovely indeed - and dreams do come true! 
I am so thrilled with all you tell me darling Girlie mine - Go ahead believ-ing in the Future - for it holds much good in store for you - Kiss Ollie for Mother, and let him Kiss you on both dear eyes for your own loving
Mamma.
