My dear Mr. Davis:-

	I have just been thinking, since receiving yours
of the 6th, how fortunate it is to have a man, whom one has
never seen, trying to discover one! I have conceived such
a feeling of gratitude toward you that is my intention to
keep hammering away at you, that you may be the man who finds
me, if I ever find myself.
	Sometimes, this every day endeavoring to force a trumpet-
cry out of the throat of a gnat seems humorous to me. I have
long walks in which I laugh at myself- then I come back and
go at it again.
	Today I had a walk, and the result of it is recorded here:

I'm a roaming in the tall, tall woods;
I'm a yelling for to be found out:
I'm wililng to deliver an assorted lot of goods
To the fellow that'll hear my shout.
I'm a ranting, nervous cuss, and I want to make a fuss,
I can soar as high as buzzard ever hovered:
It's my petted superstition I'm a genius with a mission -
And I want to, want to, want to be discovered!

I'm game to do the real right thing!
W'y, I'm even game to be damn good!
(If it's really very very absolutely necessary;
Or at least I'd be as careful as I could.)
I'm drunken with a hot mixed dream!
Here's a pile of chips on me - let's see it covered!

I'm a virgin country aching for a plow;
I'm a howling coast anhungered for a sail:
I wish the Afterwhile would condescend to be the Now!
-Mr. Christopher Columbus, hit the trail!
Sometime I'll split the spaces with a yell
That'll sound as high as buzzard ever hovered:
And if I fail to do it, I will bow and go to- well,
I want to, want to, want to be discovered!

	All of which proves that all the good poems were not
written by Alfred Austin. You will notice with what consummate
mastery I have used repetiton.
