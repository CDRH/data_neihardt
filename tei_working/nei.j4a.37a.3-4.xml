                    <salute>Dear Professor Neihart:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I felt a desire to contact you as one of your former students and convey some information you may find of interest. As you can imagine, I enjoyed your Cycle of the West class a great deal and thereby acquired a friendly feeling towards American Indians. I am a 1968 graudate of the Unviersity of Missouri School of Law and have been for the past five years practicing in Sheridan, Wyoming. Of course, this country is surrounded by historic sites such as Custer Battlefield which you taught me to appreciate. The Crow indian reservation is just north of us and I have been pleased to have an opportunity to represent interests of the Crow tribe on a few occasions. I have in the past worked to assist the Crows in setting up an alcoholism treatment center program and such things as that.</p> 
                
                <p>It is unfortunate that the American Indian now is, in many respects, looked down upon by their white brothers. Unfortunately, much of this is, as it would seem, the fault of the Indians themselves. Through my contact, I have found that a good many of them do not have any pride in themselves or their heritage. I cannot really understand this for, as you tuaght us, they have a right to be proud. They were never

                    totally defeated by the white man. Likewise, as you taught us, I respect their old heritage and cultures. I have found some in this area who, as Indians, do have pride in their heritage but they seem to be very few and far between.</p> 
                
                <p>Perhaps some of the attempts by the militants to establish their equality were needed though I must admit that I cannot totally approve of the ways and means in which they are attempting to do so.</p> 
                
                <p>It is quite strange to have experiences in the locale of points of interest that, in my college days, seemed ot be mystic, historical sites of the past, to-wit: Crow Agency, Custer Battlefield, Big Horn River, etc.</p>
                
                <p>The appreciation that you, with your interest and expertise, instilled in me sometime past will always stay with me and make an even greater appreciation grow for this beautiful country for me.</p> 
                
                <p>My best wishes to you. I hope that in the not to distant future, I can see and talk with you.</p>
