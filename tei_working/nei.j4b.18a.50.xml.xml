Dearest mama and Daddy!
<p>Albert and I met Amama last evening and went to the hotel with her. We were so relieved and happy to see her looking weel even after that <underline>hard</underline> trip. We had a good chat with her before we went home. She is surely said "Oh you two and really appreciative of what you have done for her. She is going out to Enid's after lunch today. Albert and I will get her and bring her back in to the Shelter this evening early.</p>
<p>Then tomorrow morning, I plan to go down town just thing. We'll have Amama with us tomorrow.</p>
<p>it was surely great to see her again.</p>

Love ever,
