Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>How can we thank you for your generosity in sending on the DIVINE ENCHANTMENT for the Syracuse University Library and the Neihardt Collection. It is a real treasure and a high point in our academic year. Please accept our deep thanks and know that it is in the Arents Room, the Rare Book Room of the University.</p>
<p>I am also sending on a xerox copy of A BUNDLE OF MYRR, which you permitted the Western Historical Manuscript Collection at the University of Missouri to release to us. Even though the xerox has your signature, I would like your special notation on the copy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Young advises that your second operation is now behind you and that is a relief to all of us.</p>
<p>Kindest personal regards.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Frank P Piskor</signed>
Frank P. Piskor
