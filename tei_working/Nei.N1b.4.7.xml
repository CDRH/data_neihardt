Dear Mary: 
I am so glad you like my little book. 
Yes, I do remember something about my sister's coat that was cut down for me. I am surprised that I forgot to mention it in my "testament," but there was so much else to remember. 
I am looking forward to the time when I can write about your father and my best friend. That is going to be a pleasure. I am now well along with the second volume (the adult section) and it cannot be too long utnil I shall be writing about Dr. Julius T. House. 
It will interest you to know that J.D. Young and I have bought up nearly all of yoru father's biography of me. People who have copies of it think very highly of it; and surely it is a fine piece of work, deserving much more attention than it has received. 
I like to think of you, Mary, and the old days when you were a little girl. 
With affectionate thoughts for you and your Morrie, your old friend, 
John G. Neihardt
