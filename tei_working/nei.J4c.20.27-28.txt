<p>Dear Friends:</p>

	<p>I just want to say hello and to tell you I still feel the fine glow of my visit with you. (I wrote you shortly after I reached home.) This has been a busy time, getting all the grades lined up. I have a remarkably efficient grader, who left me nothing to do but to check his work. Now I'm off until mid-Sept.</p>
	<p>We are doing a lot of building, which will continue several months. One barn, 16'x28', is about finished, and next we'll begin on an indoor riding barn, 100'x30', which will run north of the big barn and be a part of it.</p>
	<p>Several times in the first gray light of morning I've wakened and thought of you, Nita, on a "bird-walk", and often I've seen again those magnificent water-falls<sic>waterfalls</sic> and the long vistas you showed me, Slade.</p>
		<p>Bless you both!</p>

		<p>Affectionately,</p>
