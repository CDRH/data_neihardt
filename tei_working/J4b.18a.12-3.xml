Dear Ollie &amp; Enot:
<p>have you any suggestion regarding the enclosed? I'm writing Hitch suggesting that I call on him next week to work out a plan.</p>
<p>Please mail this to the folks at Bartmer Ave.</p>
<P>How is old Nei doing without our teeth? I can return them as soon as my others get back. Tell him dark the luck Gaki wants to see him awful bad and so does Nanny.</P>
Love always
Dad
