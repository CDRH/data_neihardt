Dearest Girl: 
I've just rec'd your two letters, and I'm glad you talked with Mrs. Bovard. 
Before telling Sig & Max I had worked out with Sig a scheme for going after lectures throughout Missouri, in Eastern Kansas & perhaps Eastern Oklahoma. So that when I told them everything was fine. Strange to say, they're really glad! Sig said he could break into Baldwin for awhile again, & every mouth would be just that much more. But the best thing is to send him on a circuit of Missouri colleges. This, we figure, will cost $35 to $40! I've ordered new circulars-$13 for 2000, & will have them in a week. Then we're going after the colleges. 
Sig can do more good this way now than in any other way. Mail would be too slow
