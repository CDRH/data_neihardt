December 2, 1968

Dear Alumnus:
<p>We're approaching the Centennial Celebration of the University of Nebraska. The exact date of her 100th birth-day is February 15, 1969.</p>
<p>We want it to be a great year...worthy of a GREAT University. We hope that the NU Foundation will be able to do more for the University  and its students and faculty than ever before. But this depends upon the 1968 gifts form her active alumni.</p>
<p>That's why we're sending you this SPECIAL letter.</p>
<p>We consider you among the 20 per cent of the alumni who are truly active adn have shown a concern.</p>
<p>As yet, we haven't heard from you in 1968, <underline>AND WE WANT YOUR NAME ON THE 1968 ROLL OF DONORS</underline>, published in the Centennial Year.</p>
<p>Why? Because the only true way the world can judge a University is by the caliber of its No. 1 product--its Alumni.</p>
<p>NU may be an Old Lady in age...but she's still filled with enthusiasm and vigor, and she has a bright outlook on the future. And she'll measure her Alumni with the best of them.</p>
<p>I hope you're as proud of her as she is of you.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Harry Haynie</signed>
Harry R. Haynie
President
P.S. Won't you send your 1968 gift today? A postage-paid envelope is enclosed for your convenience.
