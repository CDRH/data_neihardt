Dear Enat: Tues. Eve. 
I was delighted to find your dear letter here when I got back from a strennous day of talking. I'm so happy to know that you are happy, sweet, good Enat! Isn't it all wonderful! You see, yoru worth does matter. I'm eager to hear much more. 
Things go wonderfully well here The Joslyn Memorial affair was just about perfect in response, & the University lectures are going over finely: Perfect attention & response. I'm doing some good here. So many come to me & seem to get something. 
Dr Sealock, the Pres., will drive me to Wayne on Saturday to see Hiddy. Isn't that bully? 
Enat, there'll be a job open here - secretary to the Pres.-

at the end of this year. Think of it! I think I could laud it for you, & you'd be fine. But your chaver is better, perhaps, where you are, altho'this is a good inhibition an unusual one, & will soon have one million cash to use for new buildings & campus. I think New York is bet for you now. But had you failed to land there, this chance would have been <del>of</del> excellent. 
I'm run ragged - need sleech - and am writing this like a whirlwind. But I love you, good, dear, & very able Girl! 
Write me when you can
