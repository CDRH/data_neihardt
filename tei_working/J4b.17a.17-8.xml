Precious Alice:
<p>You must have received the drum shortly after you wrote the last Thursday. We hoped you would have the drum to use Friday.</p>
<p>You plan as to costumes (with the colors of the four quarters indicidental) is all right, of course; but I do wish when you perform the whole ceremony later on, the girls could wear cheap dresses of the proper color.</p>
<p>I should think the Spring might <unclear>well</unclear> do for all four groups.</p>
<p>Do you remember the omaha Indian air I've often whistled? If so, I could put <strike>some</strike> one of Black Elk's holy</p>
18
<p>songs in shape to be sing to that air.</p>
<p>Hiddy could give you the meaning of that song you quote. I forget; but it's a love song, I'm quite sure.</p>
<p>When you produce the complete ceremony, shouldn't you have all of Black Elk's regalia?</p>
<p>Yes, I know of Col. Rice and his sonnets; but I know his brother's work better. Cole Young Rice and I used to correspond. We were quite friendly.</p>
<p>I never forget you at night in the garden.</p>
Love always,
dear Girl!
