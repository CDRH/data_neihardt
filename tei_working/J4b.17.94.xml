Enid Darling:
<p>It makes me so happy that you and Ollie are enjoying the things we were able to give you. I Know you'll make them look their best possible, and am looking forward eagerly to our next visit to your sweet Home. Too bad the dresser is as huge. I really want it back here so may be we can bring the mirror back in May and the rest could be packed in card board adn sent here by Phillips Co. Truck. There is no hurry. Yes, use the Horine bowl, and palnt the jonquil in your garden.</p>
Loads of Love
