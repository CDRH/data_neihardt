Dearest Gaki
The Cavett - Neihardt show was great! 
We hated to see it end-
Shirley and CARM Carm, Enid, Olie, Coralie and I watched it in a Boonville Mortel. They invited us
to the office to see you in color. You did look great in color, but the black &amp; white
picture was clearer.  Carolie recorded the whole thing on her cassette tape recorder. We'll let
you hear it if you are good. 
We are delighted you are going to be here. Please don't worry yourself about the "fluid" situation
here. WE WANT YOU HERE. YOU BELONG HERE. 
If our house sells soon, we'll make an offer on the house near Enid and Ollie. I am sure you would
like it. And if we decide to take our Branson house off the market, you'd enjoy being here to,
wouldn't you? 
I am gradually getting to feel more normal. Doctor says it will take six months or more.
Fortunately I feel more competent than I did. 
Please give Myrtle &amp; J.D. my love. I'll write them, but do tell them how much I appreicate their
kindness to me. Tell J.D. my funny talk was apparently quite <unclear/>. The joke book is very good.

I am to be on a career panel at Stephens College today. - too much

extra <unclear/> going on. It is
hard to refuse. 
Much love to you as ever,
