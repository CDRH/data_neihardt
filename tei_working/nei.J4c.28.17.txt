Dear Slade:

	<p>I'm ashamed and sorry!! The copies of <hi rend="underline">Easter</hi> are only now being sent, and I fear they may not reach Ithaca before you leave; but, anyway, they carry affection. Alice, Lynn, and Erica are back home to stay! They've moved their horse business back, and the home is alive again!! They made good progress down south, but they (and I) had 15 horses here that were being neglected.</p>

-3-

and on expense. We now have some of the best horses I ever saw - one of these a stallion that you <hi rend="underline">must</hi> see.</p>
	<p>I'll be thinking of you out in your Pacific Paradise. Bless you, dear Brother!</p>

					       <p>Affectionately,</p>
