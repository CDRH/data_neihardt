Dear Ollie: 
A definite life of George Sterling is being prepared by a man in San Francisco, and he has asked that I write what I know of Geo. He died on Nov. 18, 1926, and I immediately wrote an article which was a sort of Threnody. I want a copy of it very much. It should be found (on the dignity page) in the issue of Nov 19 or so - possibly 21, 1926. 
Everything fine here. We talk much of you and Enot. 
Love always to both of you. 
Dad
