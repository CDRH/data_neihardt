Dear Ollie:
<p>This is mostly just to say hello how are you we are feeling fine and hope you are the same! But we do miss your letters, not that I'm exactly an industrious letter writer, however! I think of you and Enot a lot, and they are good thoughts.</p>
<p>Sig tells me the P-D is making bricks fly on the new building site. What seems to be the idea? Do they need the new space?</p>
<p>It seems likely we shall not go to Calif until late Aug. or early Sept., but we're not certain yet. It would be good to get acquainted with the Wub before we go. I've been waiting for the needed material to finish a rose-quartz set - a heart pendant and heart earrings, all three set with big white sapphires. Everything is finished but the metal hangers, and I should have the material soon. This is definitely a figt to the Wub. It will love to watch the pretties dangle and jiggle and glitter while it is sucking</p>
<p>I'd like to have you see the tie-pin sets I have made up so that you could choose. One is a ruby (real <strike>North</strike> So Carolina stone cute brilliant. Another is a big carbuncle (garnet) set on a brilliant golden stone. The other is the jade carving. If I just had material, I'd make them all up, but I need to choose the material myself. The pin idea is also in the nature of a Wub celebration.</p>
<p>MacMillans seem well impressed with the new book and swear they'll do their Coat. They sent me two pictures for the cover (artist's sketches) for choice &amp; suggestions. Very nice and rather striking.</p>
<p>Tell Enot it thrills me to think of the ay she feels about the baby. It will have a lovely Mama and a mighty good Dad.</p>
Affectionately
Dad Gaki
