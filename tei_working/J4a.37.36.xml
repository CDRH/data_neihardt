Dear Mr. Neihardt, 
We are wondering if it would be possible for you to make a public appearance at our school this year. 
Our fourth, fifth, and sixth graders would feel most honored. 
If this would fit into your schedule, would you please let us know when you could come and what the expenses would be? Our school day is from 9:00-11:30 A.M. and 12:30-3:00 P.M. 
We will be waiting anxiously for a reply. 
Sincerely,
Vivian Schluckebier
