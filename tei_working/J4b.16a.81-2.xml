Dearest Boy:
<p>You have made us happy with your good prospects for a job - one of which we pray may soon set you on your feet.</p>
<p>Daddy and I are planning to see you one our way to the lecture engagements. We surely need the money from them badly.. Mr Bierig is more on the job lately. He brought a coupld from Chicago the other day who seemed to like the place very much, but there has been no further development.</p>
<p>I am daily thankful you do not have to be here getting no mail day after day - Also I will be so happy to Knwo you in St Louis where all of of you children can get together occasionally, and also I trust, that Daddy and I can soon be there. For teh present there is nothing quite so important for us as the finishing of Jed Smith.</p>

<p>Daddy is getting along well with it now.</p>
<p>How happy and relieved I will be when you have a job and can do your Music every morning early and every night! That will be real living won't it. Just Thirty minutes before you go to work would Keep you happy all day! We think Maxies' idea and yours for the Western Auto. <unclear/> the best possible solution of your problems; better than any <unclear>oilling</unclear> proposition for <underline>permanent</underline>.</p>
<p>Your experience with the Piano was a good one, sad as it seemed, because it means you will have to plan to rent a home in the suburbs when the time comes for you to have your family with you.</p>
<p>I hope you just forgot my birthday and Mother' s day - but I confess not hearing from <underline>you</underline> hurt me and awful lot. Always loving you</p>
Yours,
Mama.
