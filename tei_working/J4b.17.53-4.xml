Dearest Children:
<p>The letters from all of you touched the spot and will have helped greatly in making our Gaki get well - Indeed I mean that. He and I are overwhelmed with the blessings you are - and there can be nothing in all the world so wonderful as this one. To have such grand, good and wonderful children as you are. So many, many thanks, again.</p>
<p>We here both much drawn to Mr Stark. You Know I was very deeply interested in Astrology before I came to Daddy. I had a friend in New York who worked in that Science and she surely was wise in many ways - and understood me better far than my own people ever did.</p>
<p>I have no prejudice whatever against the Negro race either - all depends on the quality of the individual. So our Joanie</p>
54
<p>is an air person, Well so is Nanny, which maybe accounts for an inner understanding?! <underline>I Know</underline> it does!</p>
<p>We had a hearty laugh over the "sore man" Indeed Nanny has <underline>just that</underline> - but he has been very sweet and patient too.</p>
<p>I Know you'd be down here Sig if Daddy were in really bad shape - but now he is really doing very well - and I am entirely able to do the work. We are just now using up the last of the coal - I have <underline>scraped</underline> the place - so it would require a broom to get up <strike>the rest</strike>anymore!! and now we are using green and dry wood - it makes a very good heat, and is so clean.</p>
<note>text below is upside down - in relation to the letter's orentiation and striked through</note>
