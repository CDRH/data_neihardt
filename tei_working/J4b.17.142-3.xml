Dear Max &amp; Joan &amp; Elaine:-
<p>It was such a lovely thing you did for the "little whosit", &amp; I know it'll someday get a great thrill out of the dear little lamb! Thank you so very, very much. How'd you know I was wishing for a nice animal picture?!- I <underline>was</underline>!  I know just where I'm going to put it, too! You can bet the babe will be told the story of "Baby Lamb Frisky" too &amp; it will b told that it was because of its Aunite &amp; cousins that it has the cute picture to look at! Thanks, Max; it's so prettily fixed!</p>
<p>Sig dropped by last <sic>nite</sic>. He should have come in time for dinner, but he didn't! Instead, he comes bringing a quart of delicious fruit salad ice cream. He spent one <underline>nite</underline> with us. We had a very nice time a - vistin', as Ol &amp; I haven't seen Sig for quite awhile. He's so busy as always. He was just out this afternoon, &amp; he &amp; I had a nice chat, drinking lemonade &amp; eating crumb cake! He had evidently made his arrangements with the new landlady near the Unitarian Church &amp; was getting his room in order etc. I wanted him to eat dinner with us <sic>tonite</sic>, but he said he couldn't make it.</p>
<p>I'm getting a bit "bulky" now - if you know what I mean!?! It's a  bit hard to get around <underline>altho'</underline> I really can't complain as I feel grand!</p>
<p>So long!</p>
Love, always,
Enid
<p>Please write one some gossip!</p>
