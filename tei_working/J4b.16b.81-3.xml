Day Before Tomorrow, 1940
Dear Oddie and Enot:
<p>Many thanks for the stove, and very dear of you to send it! We've not been at all hard put for cooking. Done a good lot of it in the pasture, and would have done it anyway for fun. Very light cooking in the house. But if it continues to rain, the stove will be handy.</p>
<p>We have paid in full for the stove sent back to Sears - quite awhile ago; adn naturally we expect another stove in exchange.</p>
<p>Sudie is right about Jed, and by spells I've had "jitters" too; but, come to think of it, nothing</p>

<p>bad has happened yet, and probably won't.</p>
<p>Yes, if you buy at present money valuation, you'll make a profit, because the 59 billion dollars debt, &amp; more coming makes inflation certain.</p>
<p>Hope old Sudie is right about selling &amp; going to California. And about the baby too! Why should life stop now? No reason. Something to plan for Enot, that farm. Of course it can happen, probably will. It's teh life, close ot the everlasting. And with machinery it's not slavery by any means.</p>
<p>If I have any more luck there'll be two in the family or maybe a ranch.</p>
Endless love
Dad.
