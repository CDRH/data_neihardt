<p>Dear George:</p>

	<p>At last I am acknowledging your generous letter. There has been so little free time, and this is an exhausting business. Even now the boys are yelling around me - dear little cusses!</p>
	<p>Your offer <hi rend="underline">is</hi> inviting and characteristically generous. I'm not exactly saying no yet, but 
                   
                     (over)

unless something fairly good happens to me, I'll have to hold a job and make money for a debt which will be due a year from this September. That is all that is in the way. I could write " I Shall Be Young with You" down there if I were free to accept the offer.</p>
	<p>Anyway, George, dear good friend, I'm grateful for your thought of me.</p>

			<p>Affectionately,</p>
                     <signature>John</signature>


<p>This is for Mrs. S. too!</p>
