Dear Mamma:
Sigurd will play over KNOX next Saturday at 10:30 A.M. He is very anxious that you should hear him, and asked me to write you at once this morning. I suppose you get KNOX often, don't you? Do you know where to turn the dial to get it? 
No more now. I'm rushed. 
Endless love, 
Jno. 
Note that it is 10:30 in the forenoon. Better begin trying at 10:15 to be sure.
