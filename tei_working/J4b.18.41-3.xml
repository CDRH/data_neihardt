Darling Enid:
<p>This must be rather rushed but it carries so much love to you and your dear ones:
The wedding was an all round success and I Know Hilda left feeling she had had all that she most earnestly desired her wedding to be. I'll tell you all about it when we are together. Now I want to say that we drank a toast to you all three and that your picture was in place made for Daddy's bust and decorated with lilacs. the napkins were swell, am washing them today to return when we leave here, which we believe will be <sic>Friday</sic> of this week. I have our mattress packed, ready for the Express man who promised to come</p>
43
<p>after things this afternoon, so please be looking for our mattress! We'll bring the 2 pillows with us, and nothing else, as you do not need any other thing now, and we <underline>do</underline> want to save all possible expense <underline>now</underline>. I hope you will not mind my desire to continue to help Maxine in St. Louis until her plans and Sigurd's mature, as I could not under any cirumstances <underline>fail</underline> her or the Wubs after promising.-</p>
<p>I'm bringing clay plaster etc so that I can continue my work and make a portrait bust of our splendid baby Nei.</p>
Auf Wiederschen then my dear dear children-
Your devoted old Mom.
<p>Hello! Love to Three!</p>
Dad.
