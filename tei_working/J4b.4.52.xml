Dear Ones:
I've done two stunts, today. 
I made $200. Golly, I'm about all in! 
Had a small & fairly appreciative audience out at the University this <del/> P.M. not much to brag about, but fiar. Tonight at the city Hall in Baugor I had a good crowd, and got away with it in good shape. They made me come back & read more lyrics. It was a new England crowd for fair - very stuff, but very attentive. They fired up only when I tried to quit & applauded steadily, tho' not boisterously until I did <unclear/> more. Afterward a number came to me and expressed appreciation. 
It was thoroughly successful here in Bauger. 
I am waiting for a 1 o'clock train to Boston. 
Bushels of love,
Jno Daddy
