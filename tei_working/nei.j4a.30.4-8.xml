<salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
</opener>

<p>Your good letter came this morning. 
Yes, I have a lovely letter from Mrs.
Aly which I enclose for you to read.</p>

<p>It sounds as if you have a busy
summer ahead. When you're in Lincoln
will you see the lady who is a sensitive?
Sometime, if she does not object, I'd like
to go there with you.</p>

<p>Everyone at our place in fine - except 
I have a summer cold which seems very
hard to eliminate. I have been as lazy 
as possible. Today I am at the
Memorial as my regular hostess is out
of town.</p>

<p>Your T.V. plans sound great. I will
have to see them. I sent your records 
to my sister Norma and to a friend in 
New York. They were delightful - only
wished there were more records.</p>

<p>When you are in Oregon you will

<pb/>

<note type="curatorial">6</note>

probably see Mrs. Aly. I will not say anything
to her about the newspaper writings until
you tell me to. Perhaps you'd rather talk to
her first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sherwood's daughter-in-law was 
to ask me to order her a Cycle. She was
so pleased to meet you that she felt she
must have the book. We have sold all
we had so mist now re order</p>

<p>The men are starting to put up the
lightning rod today. I hope it does protect
the building from fire.</p>

<p>Have a good trip and take good care
of yourself.</p>

<salute>Dear Mrs. Bennett:</salute>
</opener>

<p>Many thanks for your letter of June 20. I have
appreciated all your interest and assistance in
my work, and I am delighted to hear about the
ceremony in Nebraska. I wish I could have been
there; it was a great experience for Dr. Neihardt,
and I would specially like to have met you.</p>


<p>I am flattered that you want to read my dissertation.
It is centered on rhetoric and oral interpretation, and consequently the biographical
section is somewhat distorted, but the general
organization of the biography will follow the
rough outline of that part. I should welcome any
suggestion you could make; this is tramendous
material, and I want the biography to present as
clear a picture of Dr. Neihardt as possible.
Please do make any comment you have time to express
to me; I shall value any suggestion.</p>

<p>The interest of the University of Nebraska Press
in Dr. Neihardt's work is a very good sign. I am
writing Virginia Faulkner because I have some ideas
she may be interested in for republication of
some of the less known writing. The Poetic Values
lectures should certainly be reprinted, along with
the unfinished one the originally was intended
to be part of the series. I have been prodding
Dr. Neihardt to write the third section he meant
to add to it. If those three lectures, one
other one the same general theme, and a new one
could be put together, the book would be a full
statement of Dr. Neihardt's poetic theory, and it
ought to be done. The University of Missouri Pre<supplied>ss</supplied>
has such an idea, but nothing has come of it.
</p>

<p>Did you know that I have a bust of Dr. Neihardt?
It was made in 1948, also by Mrs. Neihardt, and
it is a remarkable piece of work. It is larger
than life--what Mrs. Neihardt called "heroic siz<supplied>e."</supplied>
Eventually it, too, should be cast in bronze. T<supplied>he</supplied>
only other bust in existence is in one of the
buildings at Wayne, and someone should work on
getting it cast. It is a much younger portrait.</p>

<p>Again may I thank you for your nice letter and
your many kindnesses. I shall hope to hear from
you again, and eventually we are sure to meet.
I shall look forward.</p>

<closer>

<salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
