<p>Dear Friends:</p>

	<p>I'm really ashamed that I haven't written you for so long a time; but you may be sure that all my thoughts of you -and there have been many- were affectionate and grateful ones. This has been rather a distracting sort of winter for me, as for most people, altho' I have no complaints to make. On the contrary, I am deeply grateful for so very much.</p>
	<p>I'm afraid the St. Louis agency did not realize conditions - both of mind and purse - among people generally. Around defense centers, there is a false sense of prosperity that misleads. If we had gone ahead with our smaller ideas, there might have been more or less of a Nebraska trip, though I don't feel sure. As it is, I <hi rend="underline">may</hi> go to several places, and I may not. It doesn't really matter in the least. My feeling for you two <hi rend="underline">does</hi> matter, and it is much auged.</p>
	<p>I've just returned from another visit (my third) at Kemper Military School. (over)

five hundred fine young men, most of them in training to be 2nd lieuts!</p>
	<p>I do hope things are going reasonably well for you. Are you, Elmer, likely to get into some good defense job? I've been trying through Lowell Mellet since a year ago last December. Mellet is one of the "upstairs cabinet", you know. He seems to want to use me; but there must be a ludicrous state of confusion in Washington.</p>
	<p>Golly! What a world they've made of it!</p>
	<p>Anyway, there <hi rend="underline">are</hi> values that matter.</p>
	<p>Dear people, I do thank you for your friendship.</p>
