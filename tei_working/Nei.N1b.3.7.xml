Dear Bower:
Bless your heart and many thanks. I certainly do deeply appreciate what you have just done in the
interest of the Dick Cavett show and my work generally. Your latest efforts are too characteristic
for thanks and I feel almost guilty when I thank you again (nevertheless, please dont' quit!). I
note that the Dick Cavett address that you give is not quite correct. It shoudl be American
Broadcasting Company, 17010 Broadway, New York, N. Y. 10019. 
It does look as though there is a ground swell of interest in my stuff. It's a constant surprise to
me. 
I have just signed an option contract with a movie producer. 
I do want to know more about Lucile's progress with the revision job. It's going to be a great day
when we see that in print. 
With the old affection, 
John G. Neihardt
