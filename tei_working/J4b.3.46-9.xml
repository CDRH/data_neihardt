Dear Mama:-
That was most interesting about the clairvoyant and I'm glad you weren't. Did you tell us everything she said? If not write it down before you forget. The fact hta tshe knew so much that we know as true makes the rest more than merely interesting. I expect Lulu to win. If I were with her awhile, I could tell her how to get the most out of herself. She must practice systematic self-suggestion & become certain of doing what she plans. There must be no doubt. The best time to do this is when she is falling asleep. This is not new thought, & there's nothing spooky about it or sentimental. It's merely discipline for the subconscious mind. I know what it does. The fact that I have driven straight for one marks for many years without any hesitancy. Proves that the system works.

But the nature of the assertion made when falling asleep must never be personal. Emphasize the work always, regarding yourself as something to be thrown away for the task. That is somehow the secret of realizing dreams-to learn how to throw yourself away on something you want to do. Lulu has been away form me so long that she will probably have some difficulty in thinking of me as intensely impersonal in my work, passionately unselfish. Before I won out no one could be expected to see that my sacrifice of anything or anyone, <del/> even my own <del/> momentary offenses and the respect I might have won in lesser ways, was to be seen ultimately as impersonal & in the highest sense <del/> unselfish. In 1913 I began a twenty-year job with no reason to feel sure that

The public would give me either honor or money for my pairs, because it was regarded impossible to write epics now, much less to get anyone to read them. I hope this doesn't sound priggish or preachy. To me it's only brass tacks. 
I know Lulu can win. I'm sending a book to her. No one has written we about it before, but I remember now that I forwarded to send it when I was there. 
We had an 18 hour rain with thunder & lightning an the 27th & 28th, and now we're having another thunder storm. It didn't get cold even tho' the wind got into the north. 
Your wood is saved a big heap of lechary & ash for the fireplace. I'll order some kitchen wood for you too.

Dr. House urges that you go to Wayne. Says all the women you know were eagerly cooking for you & even had a reception planned. Also he says be & Mrs. H. Want you. Don't worry about Mrs. Brittains stones. She is a sour selfish old woman-always was sour. 
Jno.
