<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	I've been waiting for the next letter, and I'm writing this note just to tell you that I'm thinking about you as usual, and am very eager for those questions to begin coming. It will be a joy to know you are working in that beautiful home, precious friend. I do hope the bronchitis is not worse. I wish you could let me have it for a spell! I've had it and could manage.

America big as usual. Such fine young people, and some <hi rend-"underline">not</hi> young. I'm in room 208 Old B &amp; PA Bldg, (south of J School on E. side) It's the best auditorium I've had - so well lighted by both God and man! I love to think of you three in this House! I can hardly wait to see it.
	There's more to say but this will do until I hear again. The bust was made heroic size - a bit larger than life. For this reason it might be well to have it high up. Have you considered this?

Indeed we <hi rend-"underline">have</hi> "work to do," as you say. It <hi rend-"underline">is</hi> fun to be 
<hi rend-"underline">us</hi> and have this pattern to complete, isn't it? O Lady, why did you'ns dump me out in the desert to eat grasshoppers? <hi rend-"underline">Why</hi> didn't you <hi rend-"underline">make</hi> me go on with you to the Land of Endless May? Well, you did try, and I would not listen. Yet, had I gone, I'd be <hi rend-"underline">just as here now as I am</hi>!
	So old Stewart has gone to school, and he has two beds! I suppose that if he gets to kicking

himself he just goes over to the other bed! (What's wrong with this ingenious idea?)
