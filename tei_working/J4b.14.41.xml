Dear Girl: 
The moving man came & said he would load at 9 a.m. tomorrow (Tuesday). I judge he will arrive at Branson on Wednesday morning or early in forenoon, Enid has found a kitchen cabinet, and I'll turn the dining table in on the deal 
No more now 
I'll be down Wed eve. sometime
Love always
Jno.
