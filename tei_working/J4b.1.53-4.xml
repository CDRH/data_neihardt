Have just come back from reading at the auditorium in Wheeler Hall. Had a nice crowd (about 250 to 300). Gayley introduced me & spoke of we as an eminent young <unclear/> who could no longer be questioned. Spoke of "Hugh" in glowing terms. People were very attentive & a good number spoke to me afterward & said nice things. a girl's <unclear/> (sort of West Coast Vision) wants me to give a reading there - probably Wednesday or Thursday. If there's good money in it, I'll stay for it. The Janitor of Wheeler 
-S Lolas of me as one of the five or six best jack in america <unclear/>s

Hall saw me & said: "Hello, Johnnie, I haven't seen you for 28 years. Used to go to <unclear/> with you at the Irving School in K.C.!" <unclear/> Terch was there, & a Miss Hamilton who knew Grace & Lulu at Wayne. <unclear/>, a Mr. Oloon from Wisner. 
I consider the reading a success here. 
Have been very comfortable at this club-nice easy place to be. Have to take dinner with friends of the Howards here tomorrow & will read a few lyrics to the party Have to do it to be decent. Want to be at home. 
Lovingly, Jno. 
Damn public stunts! I'd rather be with my <unclear/>, working. Nothing counts but that.
