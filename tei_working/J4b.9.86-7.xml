Auburn runs so wonderfully! 
July 13th '32.
Hiawatha Kans. 
My dear, sweet girl, 
This is where we decided to "put up" for the nite! Went to the show & missed you sweetheart - I could hardly enjoy it! 
It's a heartache to be a - way from you, but I know that it is only a temporary one - thank heavens!
I have more faith than ever in you dear, & I am sure that we both feel right about things at last! 
Got your picture in my pocket book, & your sweet face makes me miss you more than before I looked at it!
I must stop - sweetly, & mail this, 'cause dad is in a hurry to do somethin' or other! I will feel so much 
(over) 

relieved when I hear form my seet girl - at Omaha! 
Be comfortable - 'cause it is so hot now! 
In that note I dropped in your pkg - I wrote "be happy". I know you'll be happy - I know we're both happy about eachother. What I meant instead of that was - become-fortable! C? You blessed chile!! 
Always Love,
Your Sig. 
P.S. 
Going to bum aroun' in Nebraska City a while today - to kill "time"! Always remember - you dear girl that I love you & words can't express how I long for you to be with me in this beautiful country! 
S.N.
