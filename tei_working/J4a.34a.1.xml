Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I have read <underline>Black Elk Speaks</underline> and the <underline>Song of the Messiah</underline> and hope to catch up soon with your other writings.</p>
<p>I am editor of the literary magazine for the University of North Dakota, <underline>North Country</underline>. Because I'm working as an editing intern for the Omaha <underline>World-Herald</underline>, I'm near your neighborhood.</p>
<p>Could I arrange to come to interview you for the magazine some Saturday or Sunday? If so, please tell me a time that would be convenient for you. The only weekend I would not be able to come is July 14-15. I leave for home in Minnesota Aug. 25.</p>
<p>With you I would like to discuss incidents surrounding the work on your books, Idian religious beliefs as they compare with other religions, and your opinions on the current interest in Indian culture, especially its literature.</p>
Waiting your reply,
Sincerely,

Steve Aakre
