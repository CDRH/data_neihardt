Xmas 1932. 
Branson.
Darlin' girl - 
I had to go by what the Jeweler told me - as to the type of 18K? 
Mounting you would be most satisfied with. 
It is set with a genuine "garnet" 1/2 kt. size birthstone. 
Merry Xmas, & best wishes for a finer year of happiness to come! 
Always Love,
(inside) Sigurd. 
a "7" size was too large, & a "6" was a little ithgt on your fourth finger, so I figured that I couldn't make a bad mistake <unclear/> getting a "6 1/2." 
I love you dear, 
Sig.
