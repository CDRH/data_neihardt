<p>Dear Upton Sinclair:</p>

	<p>It <hi rend="underline">was</hi> a pleasure to hear from you again after so many years! Many thanks for your thought of me. Certainly my old-time feeling about you remains the same. You were always on the side of the angels and far ahead of your time; and what a dynamo you have been - and still are, I'm sure!</p>
	Of course you may use the letters if they are of any value to you. I <hi rend="underline">wish</hi> they were better ones - for your sake.</p>
	<p>I am in my ninth year at the University of Missouri, and have been having the time of my life, for this is a fine generation of young people. I give my course, <hi rend="underline">Epic America</hi> (upper class), twice a year. It is based on my <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi>, and is very popular. Our difficulty is in keeping the enrollment down. Also I give two writing courses, <hi rend="underline">Critical Essay</hi> and <hi rend="underline">The Writing of Poetry</hi>.</p>
	<p>A candidate for the doctorate (in Speech) is doing her dissertation on my work. She is making extensive research and she will write you for a bit of help. I hope

-3-

you can and will help her.</p>
	<p>What a world we have at present! Golly, golly! Mighty interesting too!</p>
	<p>With affectionate thoughts from one who has believed in you for many years,</p>

P. S. <p>My <hi rend="underline">Black Elk Speaks</hi> is going well in Germany &amp; is being translated into Serbo-Croatian; My <hi rend="underline">When the Tree Flowered</hi> was recently brought out in the <hi rend="underline">Panther Books</hi>, London.</p>
