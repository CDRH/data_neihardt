Dear Mama: 
I was so glad to find your letter awaiting me here. You've evidently been doing thrifty stunts, laying wood, potatoes, pork. That's bully. 
I'm having a fine quiet time here - such a relief after chicago & washington. It has been raining nearly all day, and I wanted to stroll out the country roads, for this is a charming country. It isn't  so beautiful as the hills - none of this country is quite as beautiful, tho middleton valley over by Frederick is wonderful in the blue twilight as I saw it. Had lunch with lovely at the army & have club in Washington yesterday & a fine talk with old chaps. Today I've been reading Dr. House's m S T have genuinely enjoyed it. I wish I might be able to peace it, and I will try. I have two stunts Nov 9th - one before Baugor teachers' club & one before English club of the Univeristy of name, which is just outside the city the latter is afternoon affair. 
I showed not be out running around like this I should be diong waht. others can't do. But that will come out all rihgt. 
There isn't much to write today, and I feel dull. 
Lots of love,
Jno.
