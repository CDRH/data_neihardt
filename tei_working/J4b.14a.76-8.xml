Sunday - 77
Enid darling, 
Your dear letter made me so happy - and you may count on us arriving Thursday afternoon. 
Daddy has to remain in St Louis till Mr Ford finishes his teeth, that may be till the 30th - so Daddy felt we should not leave here earlier and make our stay so long. Can you have Thanksgiving dinner at night? - Daddy wants to furnish the goose. but whatever you decide on, is of course O.K. with all of us, so you do not have to plan on several meats as your funny story suggests!! 
We will bring blankets and pillows, and a big case of canned goods, which you may use as you see fit - 
We are looking forward to 

78
our stay with you eagerly. 
Enid darling, I do so wish you would come home here with me after wards, and let us do some sewing together for you - I would so love to make you a dress coat, like the one I have just made for Max - and maybe a dress - and then Ollie could come down after you one weekend. How about it? - Ollie can get along without you for a little bit - and I know it owuld make us very happy, all of us. Please think about it. As for my staying up there - that is at present quite out of the question. - 
Our car is great, and I love it better than any we ever had, aside from the facts that it is roomier and easier to handle - and has a splendid heater too. 
We are all going to be so happy! Auf Wiedersehan then my darling - and lov eto your man who has forgotten this mother of his it seems! Always your devoted Mom.
