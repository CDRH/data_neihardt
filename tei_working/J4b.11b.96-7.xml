We have a beautiful canyon just a Ten miles from here, where we often go in the summer and eat spring on Canyon trips. We go and stay overnight on fox on Ninety days as we can, And I Love surely enjoyed a good many trips up there

I would surely like to visit you there and accompany you on one of your hikes.
