Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Friend-
<p>Reading yesterday of the dedication of your memorial for next Sunday - prompts me to add my bit.</p>
<p>My family came from N.E. Pennsylvania in 1880 and settle in Bancroft at that time here were fine families only.</p>
<p>My sister and I were both born in Bancroft, I in 1885 and my sister twelve years later. We knew your mother and sisters Lulu and Grace real well, and when you say you received your "spiritual beginning" there I can attest to the fact on your dear mother and sisters believed so simplicitly in you and your future.</p>
<p>A little personal thing means lots to us - too - the fact that in 1900 (approximately) my Father gave that ground to the City of Bancroft for a park - He had owned a member of acres called the "Park addition" and he thought part of it would be a nice gift to Bancroft. She was not-wealthy just public spirited and I am so glad he had a part (<unclear/>) in honoring you - his hame was F. H. Park.</p>
With best wishes,
Mrs. R. F. Frerichsen
