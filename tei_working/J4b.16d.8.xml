Dearest Children-
<p>So many thanks for all your goodness. We arrived after a lovely trip. Everyone and everything fine!</p>
<p>You have found what I left on your dresser, Please <underline>enjoy</underline> the necklace of amber but be <underline>so</underline> careful as the clasp is not easy to tighten. Don't send the things - Keep them where they are safe till I return.</p>
<p>So much love till I can find time to write.</p>
Mother - Mama.
