Dear Sterling:-

You may be sure that your delight upon hearing from me waws no greater than mine when your letter came. I had nothing at all in mind when I wrote you but a wish to tell about my belief in your genius. I wanted absolutely nothing but the memory that I had done that. You could have left silence and it would have made no appreciable difference. But you couldn't feel silenceâ€”you couldn't.

I have gained by actually doing an unselfish thing. One generally does somehow, does one not? I knew, what I expressed by inference, that no man now living know the color-values of words better than you; that no man now living is nearer to the secret of poetry than you. But
