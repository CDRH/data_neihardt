This Morning, 1942
Dear Ollie &amp; Enot:
<p>First, thanks for the teeth. I suppose Nei won't need them any more, since he has so many of his own.</p>
<p>Second, I'm sending Wallace's book. It would be fine to hope taht the mutlifarious administration can really be said to have <underline>a</underline> policy, and that Wallace expresses it. You will want Ickes' book too, perhaps. It is as wise as Wallace's, and perhaps harder headed.</p>
<p>Third, what you said about wanting to do that book yourself gone me</p>

<p>a happy thrill that lingers - and shall linger on. Mona &amp; I feel the same way about it. If it is to be done, and sooner or later it will certainly be done -, you are the one to do it. What you say of background applies to Rolfs at least as much as to you - more, I feel. If you confine your reading for a year or two to an outline I can make with no difficulty, you'll be defintely <underline>in</underline> the necessary backgroung, and it would be sure to make you happier to be there.</p>

<p>Rolfo is mroe under the influence of the contemporary consciouness than you are, for you lean by nature toward the long focus, the sense of all time and all men.</p>
<p>I've felt urged to write Kemper - and so I hardly expect anything from there. But who knows?</p>
<p>We think and think about our baby boy, and the thought makes me feel as though I were blossoming all over. Such a good boy, <sic>gol dern it, hotdo</sic>!</p>
Love always,
Dad
