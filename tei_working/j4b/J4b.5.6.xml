Dear Mama:
When I mail a letter home, it's generally for all of you; but this one is just for you. I want to tell you I love youand that it is a great part of my scheme that you should live to see as much of the succes of what I'm doing as possible. I wish you could be with me some times, so that you could realize again have much has been accomplished already and always against adds.. 
The children write dear things of you. Love is so close to you all the time, close to you all the time, closer than you generally realize, I know. I hope you aren't feeling as bad as when I left. Take as good care of yourself as you can. 
Kindest thoughts for Mary.
Jno.
