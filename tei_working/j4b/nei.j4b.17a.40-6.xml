Dear Daddy, Mama, max, and of course Joanie and Elaine,
<p>Really, you'll never know how nice it was of you all to send me such a lovely telegram. I simply bawled when I heard it over the telephone, and when I called Hilda to tell her, she did the same thing. Loads and loads of thanks, <underline>you dear marvelous people</underline>!</p>
<p>It is so beautiful outside now - and Tower Grove Park gives us a real opportunity for enjoying the outdoors. To</p>

<p>day I going to take my lunch over there.</p>
<p>The opera "La Frairata" was very good in every respect. Our dancing really went over the applause was great for every dance, and we even got to take a bow. I'm sending you the critics comments, whcih are really very unusual regarding the ballet, because they seldom even metnion it, Sherman especially. The bull-fight was supposed to be a travisty as Burke says it almost was, so that is really a compliment too. James Melton has a</p>

<p>heavenly voice much more so in person than over the radio even. He talked to us lots backstage - he's a terrible cut - up, but how he can sing! He really puts expression and passion into it. <unclear/> was very lovely and has a lovely voice. Hil Al and Millie all enjoyed the whole opera greatly. Tonight Hil, Irma, and I are going to be three in a groups of twenty four "supest" or extras, in "Cavalleria Tustiona" which is veing presented in the convention hall</p>

<p>on a double bill with Pagliacci. All we have to do is to walk across the stage in a church procession, and for this we get to see both operas an get paid something besides. Thursday evening we in the ballet get out checks for $5.50, and Hil took mine for me to deposit it in my credit. It was loads of fun being in the opera - really exciting, and strange to say more invigorating than scaring! Madam said it was O.K. too so thats a lot.</p>
<p>Now we'll settle down</p>

<p>to classes and practicing for awhile till rehearsals for recital begin.</p>
<p>this Sunday we're going to <unclear/> to go out to Eny's and ride jack's horses, both Hil and I. It honestly did me good all week to ride last Saturday!</p>
<p>I must go eat now (in the park) and then go to my lesson at the studio.</p>
<p>Mama, that bread is the best I've eaten. i love it. Still have about 1/3 left but it's not at all stole. Will you send me some more sometime?</p>
Loads of love
