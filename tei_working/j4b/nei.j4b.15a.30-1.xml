Dear Enat and Oddie:
<p>There isn't much to say here in this timeless sort of place, except that we're happy together and are sincerely grateful to you for your goodness. You were a couple of angels. The place is beautiful still, and a gentle, soaking rain came on time last night. Mama and I have been to Springfield twice about the book ends. Aluminum patterns are made and the iron casts will be ready when we go up tomorrow morning. It came out nicely.</p>
<p> Rec'd a lovely letter of regret from Dilliard about my failure to call, and enclosed was a precious note form that princely man, Bart Howard.</p>
<p>Mama &amp; I are off for the Black Hills country at the end of the week - alone. We should have a bully time. I'm in good shape again.</p>
Love to both of you.
Dad
