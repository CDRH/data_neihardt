As usual I am belated and nearly cooked with the heat - which has hardly let up since the foruth of July - and our grass trees and garden has been parched and dried up until last Thursday when we had a Terrific Electric stom - and one again on both Friday and Saturday. Everything is reeking with Moisture and the Sun shining, it seems, as it never did before making us all feel like we had just Emerged from a Turkish bath. - Now if this picture does not enlist your sympathy and also your charity for what I know is plain bad manners in not acknowledgeing the lovely, book containing the picture of Neihardt
