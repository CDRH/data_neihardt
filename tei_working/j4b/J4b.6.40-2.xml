I've told Macmillans that if this book takes hold. I can hand them another of the same size, entitled the modern mood, within two months. I do hope I may be compelled to do this second book.

calls it "positively Homeric in its sweep and power & fire." The book is only now being sent out-no reviews yet. Get a copy of the September Bookman & read the article on "The Devotion of John Neihardt". 
Received a fine letter from Dr. Stuff on the unveiling of the monument, I'm so glad he is on our ride now, He was slow in coming, but he's a true fellow, I am told & believe. 
I sent "Hilda's piece" (on xmas) to the Youth's Companion, & they'll run it on the children's page. Some difference between it & the Wars! 
Tell Great Grandma that we all love her & are so glad she is well enough to travel. We speak of her often, and the children do not forget her.

Lots of love,
