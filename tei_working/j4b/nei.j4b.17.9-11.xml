Darling Enid:
<p>Your good news makes me so happy and grateful. You surely are the most lucky girlie! A splendid husband, a Home - and now a baby to think about and love and work for! A whole Kansas whose warm glowing center is You. - My love and prayers are going out for the 3 of you now - and may God bless you and your every step.</p>
<p>We had a marvelous New Year's Day with the good news from you and all the rest of our children here. Each and every one so dear and wonderful!</p>
<p>It was great to be together - if but for 12 hours. But we hope soon to drive up for a little visit to you</p>
11
<p>all and maybe Sig can once more drive down before too long. The children all look very well indeed and full of all they are doing up there. They had lovely, heart warming things to say about you.</p>
<p>We miss them nwo that they are gone again and Joanie leaves an awfully empty place in Gaki's and Nannies hearts.</p>
<p>My big and only job now is to finish the bust - and I'm glad for the quiet in which to do so.</p>
<p>We are having April weather with thunder and lightening!</p>
Love in endlessness for you, and give Ollie my love as well -
Your Mama.
