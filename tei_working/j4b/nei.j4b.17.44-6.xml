Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>We are leaving here Thursday morning and will be with you some time Friday. We will bring the mattress as you advised Ollie, and the sausage you wanted Enid, (if Mrs Cantwell has some.) Daddy is through with the difficult part of Jed and has not yet gotten into the last part owing to feeling "up in the air" - so we think it best to make the change now. My bust is so good that I can leave it, and will cast it upon my return here in the Spring. I feel it is practically finished but I have not the perspective it takes to criticise it finally now. Mrs Miser was over and she said it was wonderful and a perfect likeness of Mr Neihardt - and Mrs Cantwell thinks so too. Daddy likes it himself</p>
46
<p>so I have good reason to feel happy over it.</p>
<p>I am praying John will get into Jed right soon - and we are hoping you are not going to trouble for us there. Enid, we do not need the dresser. - You and I will have lots of fun doing the work together - and I want you to place everything - telling me just what I am to do - I like to be told - and will not wnat to do any thing different from what you say. I am hoping you won't mind our getting up early and making coffee - because we can't sleep in the mornings - and Daddy has to work early. He is looking forward to bring with you Ollie. He gets lonesome for a man of his Kind!</p>
<p>We are bringing John's chair to sit in, in the basement when he writes.</p>
<p>Loads of Love adn Aug Wiederschen!</p>
Devotedly
Mama-Mother.
