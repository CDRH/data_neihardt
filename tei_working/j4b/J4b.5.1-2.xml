Dearest Ones:-
Had a nice evening with Schaeffelmayers last evening. Mrs. S. is a C.S. I will write Mama. Also she will write Mona, Schoeffelmayer is still flowing off quantities of steam through a dozen whistles, & so really remarkable with each whistle, but he'll never change. 
This a.m. a reporter got me - several of them - & had my picture taken by a fine photographer, four views. I'll have one sent home. also I'll have a Sunday article sent home. 
Had lunch with newspaper even today - fine bright fellows at 4 (in a few minutes) I'm to talk to two fellows here. Tonight I read up town somewhere.

I feel all right. Dallas is not so provincial & green as new York. I'll probably get through with my soul this time. Anyway, I'm feeling natural now. -
I see you all there at home so plainly. 
It is warm again today & misty. Cold yesterday. Perhaps you too have had a warmer wave. 
no used to worry about me at all. It's not like the last trip. I'll keep my identity. just be happy & remember that we were never in so good a position - all of us. Think of how my schemes are winning. It's really remarkable. 
I'll surely take that pension if it's offered, tho'. 
Lots & lots of love for each of you
Jno
