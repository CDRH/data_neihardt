Dear Ones:
<p>Immediately after you left, Mama and I, realizing that life is real and earnest, just flew around Gertil, and removed all signs of the frivolous interruptions as quickly as possible. the dishes were all washed up by the time you reached Highladnville, and the Christmas-tree litter was all removed before you reached Ozark. We were appalled at the stack of dishes, and remarked how pigishly you ate &amp; no wonder you're all so fat and sloppy. Mama found some little bed slippers and laughed heartily because it's funny to see little slippers without a little girl in them. I laughed deep bell laughs too. Today we are enjoying the quiet and the room there is in the house. We realize that children are a sort of necessity, and,</p>

<p>being very old &amp; wise, we accept the fact with fortitude, but we can't make thimbles' adn build towers &amp; spell cat all day for little girls. We have to have peace so as we can knit our brows and think important thoughts. Every time we look at an empty place, we think how nice it is. You are all nice people, and so we hope you can make an even briefer visit some time, and not eat such quantities and get so fat &amp; make so many dishes so awfully messy so that we have to fly around Gerty and feel <sic>glakid</sic> and through other when we ought to be knitting oru brows and thinking improving thoughts.</p>
With a patient sigh,
Your loveing
<sic>Dadgaki</sic>
<p>P.S. The bread you left is awful stuff, Didn't you like it either is why you left it probably.</p>
