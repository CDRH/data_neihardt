Dear Mom -
<p>I'm leaving Chicago, &amp; heading for Wisconsin points. All looks very good. Will not know the complete outcome of it 'til somewhat later when appropriations for the new season have been made.</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn't see uncle Ottocar. Undoubtedly he now has a big weight to carry. Barron Collier having passed away etc.</p>
<p>Here's loads of love for you &amp; everyone there!!</p>
<p>Please write, no later than Sun. or Monday to Madison, Wisconsin, general delivery.</p>
Endless love,
Sig
