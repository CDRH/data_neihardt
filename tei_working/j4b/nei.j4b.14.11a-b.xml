Dear Ollie & Enot: 
The Buddha arrived in fine condition, and I have a pretty pearl to put in his hands - the pearl of great price - the peace that passeth understanding. But until I know what ransom you paid, I can't go ahead with my original plan. 
Everything goes finely here. 
Love for both always,
Dad 
P.S. The pearl is genuine.
