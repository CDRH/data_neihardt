Dearest Children:
<p>We here hope you received the card I sent Thursday A.M. so that you did not worry Friday when we did not appear!</p>
<p>As things now stand, Daddy is suffering from a very painful leg caused by the cold in his muscles and the twist he gave them in the left hip which happened during the lifting of some things. We believe it safer to stay Home till he can walk which at present is quite impossible. He crawls to the bathroom, which is less painful. We think this state of things may last a few days as yet - but in any event you can Know that we are coming as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So please tell the Children the news at Southwood for me, will?</p>
<p>And <underline>please write</underline> to us here for we feel terribly cut off from all of you now. We are leaving the car loaded - so that we can start the very first morning Daddy is able to do so comfortably.</p>
<p>Loads of Love to all of you darlings - and trusting we may soon meet -</p>
Always your devoted Dad
and Mama - Mother
