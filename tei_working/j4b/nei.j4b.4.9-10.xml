Dear darling Daddy:
We all got your letters yesterday. We had <unclear/> at school yesterday & before and it was easy, first we had arithmetic and then Hygiene & then. Reading and then we had history & Geography. The teacher didn't give us very many. They had a "pre supper" last night. 
/over 
Grandma & I went & took three pies for them, It is for the school they are doing it. We just stayed until the rotations were over & then we went home. Mama & Sig & Hilda & Alice stayed with great Grandma. Great Grandma had to. have the Ivor lacked in front, she wants it locked every night, mama is going to write soon and so is Grandma. 
Loads & loads & load of kisses & barrels of hugs from us all. Enid (look on next page)

It is raining hard today & Grandma & I got in wood over at her house. Great Grandma said if I would carry in wood for them, at the end of this month she would give me $ .75c and I am going to save my money up
She gave each of us 29c
