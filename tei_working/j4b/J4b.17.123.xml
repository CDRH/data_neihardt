<p>Hello could you send the pink pet formal <unclear/></p>
Darling Girlie
<p>Your card was so welcome I'll make the 2 pairs of shorts fit you and dye them dark blue. The judpers cannot be made over because of the black Knee caps that are too long and can't be cut.</p>

Loads of Love to my ALice
from her devoted
Mom.
