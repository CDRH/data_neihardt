Dearest Children:
<p>That letter from Howes is very important, and you had better send it down right away, along with any other mail - I do not see Daddy starting up North very soon. He is terribly weak and Dr M. says <underline>not</underline> to <underline>try</underline> to walk as that would retard gettign well. Yesterday we considered askign Ollie to come down as he offered to do, but when we talked it all over we decided it would not help matters since even the act of sitting up in one position would be much too hard for Daddy. So we must all be patient and Know that this delay is merely a delay of a few days or a week or so.</p>

<p>seems to think it's time to come out - I hope they <strike>it</strike> will not be frozen.</p>
<p>Daddy is so sweet and patient and we have really been having a happy time, if only I could have had the pain instead of Daddy. Men are not meant to stand that sort of thing - and it makes me wretched to think of what the German and Greek and Italian and English boys are having to expereince. Surely something mighty grand will have to result from this war if it is to be worth the price paid in human suffering!</p>
<p>We are eager to be with you and Know you have done everything to be ready for us. We feel so grateful and happy at the thought of our visit.</p>
Loads of Love to all 3! from
Mama - Nanny
