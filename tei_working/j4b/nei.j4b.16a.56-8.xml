Dear Sig:
<p>Too bad about Curtis, but maybe the job wouldn't be the best for your purpose. The New York idea doesn't impress me, and wouldn't unless it could turn out to be a whale of an offer. New York is too far away besides being a hell-hole; and the expense of getting established there would be prohibitive now.</p>
<p>If you can land a job that gives you practice opportunity and out of which you can share a total of $10 per week above yoru expenses there, you'll be doing enough - plenty. the ten would handle piano, Sears &amp; Max here.</p>
<p>I'll be glad when I hear from Macmillan - either way. </p>
<p>What in hell did the agent mean by tell that fish story about free delivery?</p>

<p>He'll get told out for that, I'm thinking!</p>
<p>Don't be discouraged. What the hell! You'll land, by gosh. I'll manage one way or another here.</p>
Endless love, Old Man,
Dad
<p>Hope your belly is better. Mine is gaining.</p>
