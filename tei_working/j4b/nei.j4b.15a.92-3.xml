Sunday A.M.

Dear Ladies:
<p>I wrote a wonderfully interesting letter at Cincinnati, and now I feel interesting all over again; so I'm writing. We played around Cincinnati yesterday forenoon (to little purpose) and then stuck out for Goshen, about 260 miles northwest. At 5 P.M. we came to Warsaw, 34 miles from Goshen, and Sig called Kreider by phone. Kreider drove to Indianapolis, and would pass through Warsaw! So he told us to wait at the hotel for him. We met, and he gave us the key to his house and told us to move in. We did. It was queer, breaking into the big dark house. We snooped all over it to get acquainted. Sig played awhile, then we went to bed. We have just had a nice breakfast, and are looking forward to Kreider's return this P.M.</p>
<p>Kreider is getting on well now, but he looks as though</p>

-2-
<p>he'd returned from the grave. In ten days he will start for California - then South America.</p>
<p>it was in this house last about 25 years ago. It all seems quite familiar yet. There are symptoms of bacheloritis here and there throughout the big beautiful home. Things need fixing a bit, and renovating.</p>
<p>It frosted heavily at Cincinnati night before last, and here last night. What a change from the frustrating heat at Jackson, Miss., four nights ago! Here it is definitely fall, and the colors in the trees are beautiful.</p>
<p>Isn't this a wonderfully interesting letter?! I'll be glad when the next hard run (Evansville) is past. Wonder how the 3 wks. at Knox will be.</p>
<p>Am looking forward to mail at South Bend.</p>
Love always
