Dearest Eny!
<p>I meant to mail you a copy of the lyric Daddy wrote for us before now, but it slipped my mind. Anyway, here it is-</p>
<p>I was visiting with Millie (by the way - she's in love!) yesterday, and we started talking about you. Among other things, Millie said: "Enid and Ollie really have found a way of life, haven't they?" that is quite so, and I think it a very good thing to be said of anyone.</p>
<p>Millie is really a pal. We want to drive out some evening to see you and Ollie. O.K.? Perhaps we'll bring the Doctor (a chemist at Mansane out with us.</p>
Au revoir, Eny, and my love, to you,
Ollie, and Nei,
Hilda

FOR ALBERT AND HILDA
(Remembering their garden wedding)
<lg><l>Whatever skies may darken,</l>
<l>One blue-gold noon remains</l>
<l>Forever, hushed to hearken</l>
<l>Between the April rains; </l>
<l>Serene in living glory</l>
<l>With what it hears and heard -</l>
<l>The new-old sacred story,</l>
<l>And one applauding bird.</l>

<l>The hedges still are leaning,</l>
<l>The fountain's tinkle dies</l>
<l>To hear the hush, and meaning</l>
<l>Of what it prophecies;</l>
<l>And two made one shall hear it</l>
<l>As long as life endures:</l>

<underline><l>The good red road of spirit,</l>
The hard black road are yours.</l>
<l>But holy, failing never,</l>
<l>Their crossing place shall be;</l>
<l>For there shall spring forever</l>
<l>And soar the shielding Tree</l>
<l>And ahen two hearts thereunder</l>
<l>Recall the plighted words,</l>
<l>The Tree shall bloom with wonder</l>
<l>And fillwith singing birds.</underline></l></lg>
