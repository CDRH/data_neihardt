Dear Mama: 
Branson, Mo. 
I'm surely gald the radio has arrived at last! Have the man tell you if it's all there and let me know. I am still trying to get a 25 cycle trickle charger. Montgomery Ward say$ they can't furnish. I'm after Sears Roebuck. But even if you don't get the charger, you can have Binkley charge the big battery when needed. 
Endless love, 
Jno. 
Find out all you need to know from the man who imitates - about batteries & about turning off the tales when not in use. Watch this particularly.
