Precious Mona &amp; Amama:
<p>I'm killing part of a day here. Will leave at noon - &amp; reach Lafayette at 3:25 P.M. Happily, the main line train which I was supposed to catch here, had been gone an hour when we arrived on the galloping motor train from Hannibal. Golly, what a jumping, jiggling ride from 5 P.M. until 9:45 P.M.! You see, I've been off the main line of travel from East to West. It runs through St. Louis &amp; I didn't want to run away through this way.. It has been amusing too.</p>
<p>Golden weather until this morning, and now</p>
81
<p>it's raining in a slow melancholy way.</p>
<p>I spent last evening thinking about Hiddy's recital, and I feel sure she surprised herself. Too bad we couldn't hear her; but we will hear her another time.</p>
<p>I think a great deal of you two there, and I'm eager to be at home. Surely, Amama, you are feeling a good deal better.</p>
<p>Mona, it was lovely the way many spoke of you at Kirksville.</p>
<p>Be good to yourselves.</p>
Endless love,
Jno.
<p>Pet old Doc for me!</p>
