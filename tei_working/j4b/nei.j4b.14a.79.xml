Mr. Elmer E. Holm, 
Marisville, Nebraska. 
Dear Mr. Holm: 
I am hoping that I have not waited so long that the following may not be of use to you: 
About my mother: I am grateful and indeed fortunate in having a mother about whom only the finest things can be said. She has always had uppermost in her mind the ambition to do the things that would make happiness for others. Through her genuine love, and her interest in seeing each member of the family do what is representative of his or finest ability, she has been successful. 
While we lived in Bancroft, Neb., and for a good many years at our home in Branson, Mo., she was at her best as a violinist. Her playing was characterized by an exquisite tone quality together with an interpretation that played a very important part in helping her children to develop in their early years a definite taste for only the truly in-spired and beautiful things in music. She was an instructor in violin to pupils who came to her from considerable distances while our home was in Bancroft Nebraska. She never took part in outside activities; as her interest was always in the home. 
In recent years she has been devoting spare time to sculpture, her major talent, and has done many beautiful things, ranging from small reliefs and busts of my father, and the novelty 'Ozark Stump Baby', on up to life-size figures of my two little girls. One of the latter being mounted in our pool, and the other on a concrete base at one end of the circle drive, at our home in Branson, Missouri. Throughout our lives, to look at these works of art, will bring XXXX happy memories of the part she has played in the Neihardt family. 
Trusting that you may gather useful info. from the above.
