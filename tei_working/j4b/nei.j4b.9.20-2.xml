Dear Enid-
Recieved the note and its contents as usual and am as usual saying many thanks - this will be just a note as I am going to hear the Messiah this afternoon with one of Aunt Lora's neighbors - It is given at the college chapel. The ground is white with snow and is quite cool altho not freezing - I am wondering how it is down home, Enid dear I think I left water in the alluminum pail. I emptied the one pail and turned itupside down on the stove - what have you been doing dear, you say you are not wokring on your rug. I have sent Auntie Grace's to her - It was very pretty. Aunt Lora had roast duck for dinner today Myrtle and I washed the dishes

<unclear/> then I came up stairs and had my nap.-till mama my Birthday box arrived G.K. and is safely tucked away in my closet  - I am sending a little box to Branson which of course you will take care of until Christmas I wonder if I have told you that I am wearing my new garters and they are fine, I surely have told mama but I can't remember  - I must write to Auntie Grace today and will just say I love you always the same. I had such a nice letter from Mrs. Garner. I am so glad to hear from I am happy here - they are all so nice and I do just waht I want to I get up when Aunt Lora and Uncle Jim do and eat breakfast at 6 Every morning. - I am going to fix my brown silk dress this week. loads & loads of love to you Enid dear from Grandma.
