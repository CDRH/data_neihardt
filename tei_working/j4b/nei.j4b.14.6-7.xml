Dear Ollie and Enot:
Mama arrived last evening right side up, with the typewriter - for which many thanks. A nice wet rain came, as asked for, this morning - and the sky looks wet still. Everyone here is happy. As for St. Louis and the P-D, I've closed the door on all that, and I never was up there, at all. Still - a - check from J. P wouldn't hurt. 
Sig has Dick's engine in fine running order, and we've had several voyages. We are to keep the motor here and use it as we please. Sig & I cut the propeller down half, & made a nice job of it - so now the little engine can do its stuff without laboring. 
Nothing happens here but sunrise and sunset and stars - save for the nice rain. 
We'll see that the typewriter isn't touched by the Wubs - it will be left covered. 
I'm eager, Ollie, to hear about your bout with Mrs. Craver, Give as comprehensive ^a report as possible.

Love and kisses to both - of you - evenly divided. 
Dad 
More power to the pet rat!
