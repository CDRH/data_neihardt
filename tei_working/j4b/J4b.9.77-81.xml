Sat. Eve!

Dear Max, 
Made the trip in good shape, so I guess every-thing's going O.K. 
It took 6 hours of driv-ing time, as I figured! You know - I guessed the six hours! Not such a wild guess? 
Well, all I can say is the usual thing: I miss you something awful! Gosh, I do not know of anything I'd rather do than to think of you!! Unless it would be to see you!

I escaped the derned old "reporters"-so I'd have a chance to write you! 
You probably know how boresome it is in a strange envir-onment to have some monkey ask a lot of questions! 
Went thru Butler & Adrian this afternoon! Seems like quite a nice country around Butler! 
Dr. Barris Jenkins is a fine fellow! But his pet, "Bulldog", has been playing awfully

rough with me! I've never seen a more playful dog! 
Probably will be at Branson by Monday evening! 
K.C. isn't seemingly very far away from you my dear, but it is a long ways when I think about how we averaged 46 m.p.h for 6 solid hours of running time! 
I just love you so much that it gives me a heartache to go away from you!! You are so dear &

sweet that I'd like to be hugging you all the time (ambitious, eh?) Impossible? Well quite so! Therefore I just have to "make hay when the sun does shine"!
I'd better hush up 'til I see you, you darling!! 
Always remember, my sweety - that I love you more than words can express! 
With Love - 
Always,
Your Sig. 
P.S. 
I like adjectives, (so you have noticed)
