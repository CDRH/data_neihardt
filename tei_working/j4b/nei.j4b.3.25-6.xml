My Dear girl; Your letter has been with me for several days. but has been delayed because Mona has been sick and John was gone. So you can see i had little time for letters. John says for you to take the Burlington from Omaha. and change at K.C. but if you get a Branson sleeper at K.C. you will not have to change at Carthage. It is no trouble to change there and you can save <unclear/> by changing. And too, be sure you take the 4:30 p.m. at Omaha. You will make better time, leaving Omaha at 4:30 you reach Branson the next day 11:15 which is good time. It is lovely of you to see that your mother gets her vacation. otherwise I should be in - 

patient. Come when it suits you best. 26
Mona is quite well again and John is home. So things are running normally again. 
Love to you and come when you can, 
Alice M. Neihardt
