Dear Girl:
<p>We came to Kreider's from Nazareth College (Kalamazoo) Friday A.M. Been having a real rest here, and I've completely cured a cold that was making me short-breatht. Soon we'll start for Ada, Ohio, - about 140 or 150 miles. Two long jumps after that, and then no jumps for 3 wks. Nice time at Nazareth, but a short stay. The students average considerably younger there, &amp; there was a large group of small boys from the Academy. Everything was quite lovely.</p>
<p>The weatehr is wonderful now, &amp; the tree colors are otherwordly - so many hard maples.</p>
<p>Kreides was violently sick yesterday - retching and dysentery. He fainted in my arms. Somethign was tried, and it worked magically. He fell quickly into a deep sleep, woke in an hour &amp; a half</p>

<p>He was really terribly sick. Wanted to die.</p>

<p>and called me, saying: "O I'm so much better - I slept so soundly!!! He added, "You did it! I <underline>know</underline> you did! I knew you were doing it!" I talked him out of that. But something <underline>did</underline> happen somehow.</p>
<p>He's all right now; but we'll give him an injection before we go.</p>
<p>This morning he came to me with the lace, I enclose, and asked if you'd like it. He said: "It was Mama's." Do of him a note. He's leaving for California &amp; So. America, next Tues., but a letter will catch him.</p>
<p>Tell Max I think of the way she's plugging ahead on that voluminous correspondence, and sincerely appreciate what she's doing. Good girl!</p>
Encless love to you. And love to Max &amp; the young ladies. Dog-on-it! Does Jaine still want to kiss Gaki? Pettings for Mrs. Brown.
Jno. 
Dad.
