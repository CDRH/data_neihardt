Dear Mama:-
We have your second letter, written at Mason's. Today a photo of you and the monument came. Bully! We have seen a number of newspaper articles also, and pricing all accounts together, we have a pretty clear idea of what happened. So glad you were there to enjoy it - so glad I was not there. 
This note is written principally to say that you should not hurry off to Grinnell I leave anything and one that you might enjoy doing. 
There is no hurry. Lulu writes that & he wants you to go there. A fine idea, I think.

Everything is fine here.
We are expecting a letter from Miss Rentz Judge said she seemed "quite herself.", so we are hoping to hear that the sensation in her left cheek has gone and that she is not worrying. Give her a thousand kind thoughts from us. 
With love,
Jno
