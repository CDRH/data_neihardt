Darling Enid
We have been staying in same lovely camp where you and Daddy were - and are simply "into" about this city. It is a remarkably lovely place to live in, and would be so wonderful for Ollie and you. Daddy has talked to the paper here - the one that is most looked up to - (the same people own both papers, the Telegram is the sensational one) Daddy told the truth about Ollie and they are looking for a man of ex actly his qualifications, they don't want a very young man they said but one who has real experience along various lines of newspaper work. Now they gave Daddy a paper for Ollie to fill out, and we are sending it to him by air mail, as we are send-ing you this. Be hopeful, and happy my darling, for I know the two of you are going to make good together
Loads of Love 
Mama

Enot: Send mail by air to Flagstaff, Arizona. Looks as though I may have got Ollie a job here on the Tribune. They seemed eager & asked him to apply. I've written him & sent an application to fill out. 
Endless love, 
Dad 
Affection to old lady Ruth!
