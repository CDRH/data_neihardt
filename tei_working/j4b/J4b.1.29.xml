Dear Lulu:-
Just a line to tell some news. Allen, head of the associated press in London, has sjust asked me if I would consider accepting a <unclear/> as date gate with the Belgian Relief Commission. I would be stationed in either Belgium or northern France & my duties would be concerned with distribution of sufferers to civilian population in my district. Allen says he is sure there would be no difficulty in getting me the appoitnment. 
I have wired that I would accept, providing there is enough money in it. To <unclear/> my leaving my work here.  all expenses are paid by the Commission, but I think the associated press would expect to use me as a correspondent. 
I would not go right away, even if I should take the post. 
Love to all,
Jno
