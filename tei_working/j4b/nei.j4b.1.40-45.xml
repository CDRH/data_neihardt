                    And on a drier, they'd simply sell you into slavery for daring to eat so much!
                    I've dodged the diners &amp; have eaten three times at the Harry eating houses,
                    where the train stops 25 mins. Pretty reasonable prices, considering. I've eaten
                    prunes &amp; milk mostly. and these with the blessed kissed cookies have opened

                <p>you.</p> 
                <p>I hope Enid has received her spoon &amp; Sig his Indian born. Pueblo Indians
                made both. I sent a lot of stuff about Santa Fe. Mona, you can explain to the
                nubs about the Pueblos, wont' you? I hope you folks are feeling well. I do
                wish so much you were with me. And mona, dear you must know what a wonderful land we
                have: So big &amp; so beautifully empty! 500 miles at a stretch that is
                vacant &amp; weird as the moon. We must move West sooner or later. It's getting too
                swing back there. People get narrow with their banned hags &amp; cable. Freer here. But I would prefer Santa Fe to Los Angeles. It's dinstinctive. no other place on earth like it-couldn't be. It gets its character from the ancient Pueblo Indians.</p>
