Dearest Amama!
<p>Before another day hurries by, I want to write to my darling Amama! I have been so very busy. It is really strange how full my days are - I wonder at people who say they do not know what to do with their time!</p>
<p>How are you liking it in Branson? I hope you are getting all the rest and quiet relaxation which you need. Mama writes she is</p>

<p>so happy to be there with you.</p>
<p>I have a bicycle now! I'm looking forward to having good times riding it, both alone and with my friends. If we should get a small house in the county, then I'd really use it.</p>
<p>It was just wonderful to spend that one day with you, our one and only Amama. I wish we could promise ourselves a trip to Branson to see you - but right now that does look doubtful. Our dashing week-end trips to Branson last year put Albert's tires in a bad state, and of course he'd have a hard time to get away on a Saturday. By the way, Albert was told that he has just been deferred again, so he is safe from the Army for another six months! We are all very pleased, to say the least. Surely he is doing "his part" best where he is now, and the authorities recognize that fact.</p>
<p>"My" children just called, so I had to leave</p>

<p>this writing and go find blouses.</p>
<p>The Bully <unclear>Hops</unclear> Albert had came in handy, as he had expected. He gave them to Joan and Elaine, who had done away with all of their's!</p>
<p>Please write to me sometime, wont' you?</p>
Loving you endlessly as ever,
your 
Hilda
