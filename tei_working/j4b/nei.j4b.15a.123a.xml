Dearest Mama:
<p>Thanks for your fine letter.  I'm glad too about the visits with Kreider. It merely confirms that I <underline>am</underline> 'going places'.</p>
<p>I have a lovely photo of him at the piano. On it he wrote "For Sigurd in whom I am well pleased". Isn't that fine of him? Tell Max I have had this framed. I often feel the need of wiring you folks at home, especially when I feel that you're wondering about us. Dad doesn't go in for such things, you know. So please don't mention that I ever wire you. The short wires he did know about. I'm merely referring to the longer one I sent from Ada, Ohio.</p>
<p>Must close now. Endless love always for you,</p>
<underline>Sig.</underline>
