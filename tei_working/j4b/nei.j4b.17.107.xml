Dear Enot Peanot:
<p>Can you have this copied and back to me by, say, Monday? You know I'm grateful for your work on the MS - beautiful job it is! And you must knwo that I love <underline>you</underline> and <underline>Oddie </underline>and the <underline>Wubbity-wub-dub-dub</underline>. Gaki can hardly wait to see it and feel it pee its pants!</p>
<p>Please send me the typed copy alone, holding the original copy there, so that if anything happens to the mail <underline>one</underline> copy will be safe.</p>
Endless love
Dad Gaki
<p>P.S. One second thought, it seems as well to send both copies at once. <strike>I - Dad</strike></p>
