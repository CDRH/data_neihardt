Dear Ollie, Enot &amp; Nei:
<p>Just came over from K---. Will run down to Hannibal tomorrow &amp; take the Wabash direct to Lafayette.</p>
<p>Wonderful time at Kirksville! Large audience - mostly teachers - and perfect attention for 50 minutes. I gave them the Messiah at 1 o'clock I took a group of classes for an hour, &amp; it was ane of those happy events. It gave me joy. Those dear young people!</p>
<p>I've thought much of you and of how good you have been</p>78
<p>to us. It's really something fine to think about and I keep seeing old Neis illuminated little face! The darling! It was sweet to hear him yell at me over the phone. I'm sure he knew it was Gaki.</p>
<p>I do love you three, together and separately.</p>
Dad
