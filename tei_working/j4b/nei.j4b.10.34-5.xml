Dear Hiddy: 
I enclose seven bucks. Let me know how well you can really come out on $7 a week. 
I tried to plan a way to have you have this week end, but it seemed best to get you next Friday I let you go back on the train Saturday evening so you may count on it. The Auburn will be fixed again by that time. Did they tell you how the door got knocked off? Had to send to Auburn, Indiana, for new hinges. 
I thought the Desk Sergeant would be nice to you. I'll bet he was tickled! It's a wonder some wise pedestrian didn't report you to. the police. That woudl have been a cark under the circumstances. 
But wait until you see the new gun & holster. Good Lord! 
Endless love,
Dad 
How much do you need for shoes? 
Let me know at once.
