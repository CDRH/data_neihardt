Branson Missouri Dec. 31st 1922 
Dear Miss Piper: 
I am thanking you fo rthose nice little animals you sent us. They looked so cute, and tasted so good we ate them in a minute. The weather is real wet now because it is raining. We have had two or three rains but no snow. Grandma 
18
has gone on a trip, She is at Minneapolis now, But she is going to Grinnell Iowa to get our Great Grandma She is going to bring her home with her to live with us. 
They had a xmas tree down town, and all the children under twelve years old got a sack of candy with an apple and orange in it. We also had one here at home.
