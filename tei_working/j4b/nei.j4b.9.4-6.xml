My Dear little girl;
I love you altho it does mean that I don't - my letter writing has been so curtailed all this winter - and some times I think I have written and have not - this morning I got panicky-I could not remember if I had written your xmas letter - and if ^I have you will know what the matter is - this is a hectic house hold - Every one so busy and so disorderly and when I try to tidy up in the morning I am all tired out when I am thru and in no notion to write letters.-So dear of you to remember me - I can say that again and again the cause I never cease won-dering that I should be so generous-ly remembered - John Enid and Sigurd start off in their little ford <unclear/> for the purpose, to St Louis Every Morning-John to the Post dispatch Enid to her secretarial Job it the number 

<unclear/> aviation school, Sigurd to the 6
Ranken Mechanical school - the leave here at 7:30 and return at 6:30 - the little girls go to School Hilda has to take her lunch - so Mona and I are alone all day. Except for the noon tour when Alice comes home I am getting so anxious to go home but they say I can't until March but I'm sure it will be the very first day.-We have been having such dreadful weather snow sleet. rain and sleet rain snow - one or the other all the time, we have not seen the aun for eleven days - I had a car from Miss Fish and one from Mrs Wilson - It was ncie to be remember by all my girls, Dear girl I feel that I must begin right now to have you plan to go to the Ozarks next Summer you really should - It is lunchtime and I must go down - this brings love to you dear little girl, write when you feel like it lovingly Alice Neihardt
