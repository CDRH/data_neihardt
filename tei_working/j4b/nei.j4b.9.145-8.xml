Sweetheart, 
Here's another note! I didn't receive any letter from you today % Judge; but I assume that all is O.K. with you & the Ozarks! 
I have several thigns to talk with you about when I get home; & they are very much convincing of the many things we've talked over before! C? This trip has been a hard one to stand! Nothing specially pleas-ant, without you!

Hope I'll receive a letter from you again before I'm ready to return! 
May get a job here in Omaha - one can never tell! 
You see, I won't leave here until Wednesday noon! 
If you are well, & happy as possible; then that is all I care to know (outside of our mutual feelings!) I love you Maxine, & am certainly sure of it! 
hope there has been no misunderstandings caused in my letters! Always take things

in the best way, because it is a fact that I would never mean them any other way even if they sounded queer! 
You know, letters are never true to the strict feelings & thoughts of a person! I have to drive Leslies to a funeral (in Auburn "8") down at Ashland! 
I am about ready to start & am missing you so terribly! 
Oh Lord, I feel miserable about it! You'll perhaps never know just how much I miss my dear girl! 
Always I love you!! 
your Sig.
