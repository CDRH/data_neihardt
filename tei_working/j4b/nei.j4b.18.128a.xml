Dearest Mom:-
<p>Gregg Shorthand Dictionary (a tiny brown book) is down there? Sue Harrrison could use it &amp; I'd love to be able to give it to her. Also, I believe my Gregg Speed Studies is there. I left quite a few books that I had in the library there &amp; never looked for them. If this is around, I'd be tickled if you could mail it to me (the Gregg dictionary mainly).</p>
<p>All goes well here. Write us, won't you? We're pretty busy people.</p>
Loads o' Love, 
always, Enid
