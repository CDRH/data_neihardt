Dear Ones: -
Little Newcastle, with a population of 500 turned out of 200 people last night & gave me $42! Surprising some people from Sioux City came over (30 miles) I got practically no sleep last night - to bed at 1 o clock and up at 5. Heard every hour strike. Will sleep on train today - 6 hours, I've done 2 stunts. now - a pretty hard experience, and I need a rest. Mama, I'll surely encourage Lulu. 
I'm constantly being surprised at how people <unclear/> me at sight. Strangers come to me & speak this morning The brakeman and: "It isn't often we have so distinguished a person aboard this train" I said "I hope it hasn't hurt the train!" Love Jno.
