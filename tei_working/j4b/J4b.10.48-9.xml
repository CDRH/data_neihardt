Dear Hiddy: 
I had intended to write you sooner, but I've been more than ordinarily occupied with a review of Roosevelt's "On Our Way". It has been a hard job to tell the truth & still to be fair. I think I got a statement that will not seem foolish in 20 years. 
Everything is going finely here. Mama was sick, & is feeling better now; and I'm not so much in the dark. There won't be anything wrong if I can keep it, you may be sure. 
We made the round trip to Springfield in 3 hrs including the stop there and a short one at Ozark. 
Dr. Plank is here agian. The two had a big glorious talk past yesterday pm, & I had supper with him at the Malone. he will be here for dinner today & will leave tomorrow. He took the Messiah M S to read last night. 
Endless love, old kid! 
Dad.

Your Leader editorial writer grows wilder & wilder like the flower in the song Good Lord!

I'm really planning on the Black Hills. Hope it may prove possible, as I think it will, and <unclear/> just, as I think it may. 
Dad
