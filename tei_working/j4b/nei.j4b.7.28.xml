Dear Mama: 
Really, you've got it all wrong about the radio. That's your "conscience", damn it! Curiously enough, just this morning, coming to town on the train, I was thinking how perfectly reasonable and right it is that you should have a good radio. It will add to your happiness, give you a new interest, keep you in touch with the world in many ways. The price isn't very awful, as you seem to think, and as for your being in debt, you needn't consider that at all. You really have a fine outfit - ill have a better one when you get the charger. Six <unclear/> make a strong receiving set, and when the weather gets better and colder, you'll be astonished at the distance your set will reach. You will sometimes get European stations, I feel pretty sure; and there should be no station on our continent out of your reach. You must get some coaching on tuning in and reeling for distant stations. Does your control show wave lengths? <del/> 
I'm reallly happy over the <unclear/> of your having the outfit. All of us are. 
Love always, 
Jno. 
Just take the rad. for granted & enjoy it.
