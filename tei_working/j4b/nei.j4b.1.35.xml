Dear Folks: -
I'm just now getting around to my xmas letters, having had a number of things to keep me jumping. I needed ties and socks - and got them! Had practically everything else for my Western Trip, and I hate to buy good ties - they cost so like it-!! The one you sent, Donald, <del/> is a dinger, and I'll wear it with pride on The Coast. Many many thanks.
The Paper & envelopes were intended for house use - a general gift. 
I've got the following engagements for lectures and readings:
Wesleyan University, Jan 16th
Hastings College, Jan 18th
Wyoming University, Feb 18th
Stanford University, Feb 26th
University of California, Feb 28th 
Chadron State <unclear/>, March 15th
I expect to have two other dates beside these. 
Expect to leave for California on Feb 16th and be back here March 17th. Will go by the Southern Route (through Santa Fe) and back through Portland, Seattle & Butte to Chadron. David Starr Jordan wants me to, stay with him while I'm at Stanford, & I'll be with JOhn <unclear/> "Howard at Berkeley. It's a big thing for me. Will help in a financial way, give me a knowledge of the next that I need, & is worth a great deal as advertising. 
Have 1900 lives on "The Song of Three Friends". You will like it better than the other, donald it's a real he story for men-folks! 
Everybody well here. Hilda is an angel fairy wub. God! how she eats - and walks & says long unintelligible sentences, with here & there a really truly word. 
affectionately, 
Jno
