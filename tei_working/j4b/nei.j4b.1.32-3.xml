Dear Lulu & Donald:-
I haven't written you for a long time, but I think about you a lot. Can't we see you down here again <del/> next summer? Have you thought about it at all? Our <unclear/> would have the time of their lives together, & we could all go down to the creek! Donald would like that. I wish you'd try to come, even if we don't go to the creek. 
Had a nice time in Indiana, but especially nice in Chicago. I spent an afternoon with Mrs. <unclear/> Vaughn Woody. She is a sweet woman of about 54. When I was going she said: "I am going to love you: & when you come to Chicago you must make my house your home & occupy the Poet's Room".

some <del/> great facts have slept there - lake masefield. 
She invited me to give a short lecture before the <unclear/> club at the Little Theatre in Chicago on April 26th. I declined. The lecture was to be on Edwin A. Robinson, who, by the way, sent me his last book of verse. I understand I'm to be invited to give a reading <del/> before the Fornightly Club in Chicago next <unclear/>. That I'll accept. Mrs. Woody gave me a copy of her husband's complete focus with her autograph us <unclear/>. Woody is dead. You know. 
I hear that the State normal at Chadron, Nebr. will have me there soon. More <unclear/>! Welcome home to them, as always!

am sending the M S of my Selected <unclear/> to <unclear/> next week for publication in the Fall, I think <del>"The Song of Three Friends"</del> is developing finely. "Hugh "receives very high praise.
How are the Boys? Are you all well? 
Lots of love to all four. 
Jno.
