Dearest Girl: 
By this time Amama is with you, and I'm glad. We were a bit disappointed that she didn't stop here awhile; but of course it was just as well, since we'll be coming soon. I'll be through here a week from tomorrow, and I supopse we'll get away Saturday or Sunday There's no news here. I'm waiting to make up the page - at 1:30 - and have everything ready. There is enough type on hand for next weeks page too. Bovard gave me 4 weeks, on full pay, of course ^(in advance) you remember I used to get only 3 weeks. 
I hope the rain helped the looks of the place. There'll be more in August. 
Endless love, dearest One! 
Jno 
I rec'd the ring. Thanks!
