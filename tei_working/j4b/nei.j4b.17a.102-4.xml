Dearest Enid
<p>I am writing today mainly to enclose the recent letter I received from Maxine which will show you her real self. She cannot do more, and I'm so gald Daddy and I can have the Wubs. They are such dear companions and are happy, and living the way children should. Please return Max's letter when you write again. I do so want you to give Maxie a lift in spirit by asking her to your lovely Home and darling baby about whom she has written so enthusiastically. You are a very fortunate woman, and can well afford to be a friend to Max, who is far less well cared for. You <underline>might</underline> have been less lucky! So dear daughter of mine, be generous.</p>
<p>Daddy is now making <underline>casts</underline> of the little lamp! The piece mold was</p>
104
<p>very difficult to make and he did a beautiful job on it.</p>
<p>Enid will you send my violin down to me by Hilda who is coming Home this next weekend <underline>I think</underline>. She has some songs ready for me to learn the violin part to, and I'm eager to do so again. Won't it be fun to be playing with your own daughter? Remember what good times you and I had that way, when you played the Piano?</p>
<p>It must be possible for me to see Neihardt this Spring some time and also to be at Alices recital - There just has to be a way!</p>
Endless loving you three
your devoted
Mom.
