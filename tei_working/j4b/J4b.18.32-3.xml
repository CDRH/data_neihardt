Precious Hiddy &amp; Alice:
<p>There's no news, except that Mama is definitely on the mend. I was a bit weak &amp; wobbly, but I'm on my toes now ready to fight furiously, bleed copiously and die as often as possible for each of the celebrated freedoms.</p>
<p>I'm sending a letter from Cralle which will interest you mildly because you know the man.</p>
<p>I do hope the weather may favor your proposed trip this week end. I'd go back with you, as I'd have to leave on Sunday anyway; and the trip from St. Louis would be easier &amp; cheaper than from here to Boonville.</p>
<p>George sends love, but the rest of us don't like you. we do too the very idea!</p>
Dad
<margin>I <underline>might</underline> need 5 extra dollars for my trip, but probably not. <underline>Are</underline> there that many?</margin>
