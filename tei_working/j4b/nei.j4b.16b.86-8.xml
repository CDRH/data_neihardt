<p>Hello! Is that you? -Yeah.- Uh-huh. -O probably about three P.M. -No, straight in to Southwood, and then your place in the evening - O yeah! it's a dandy. Came yesterday and I set it up. Looks like a cooking wonder. When Mama first saw it, she yelled "Suffering Jesus!" right before the dray gentlemen, I said "Ain't it lovely?" - How's that? - O just fine, how're you? - He's fine too, only he's all scratched up again from fighting. - Yeah, we'll be seeing you. Slam, chick.</p>
