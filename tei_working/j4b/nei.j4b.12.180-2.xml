Darling: 
Hilda and I had a good little talk this afternoon and we both feel it would be very disa-greeable and quite unnecessary have an extra person around when Virginia goes. One of the children would always be with me - and when Amama comes both could go away if they wanted to of an afternoon. Amama wants to be in a modern Hotel with her own both - and it would be useless to try to change her mind; I hope she will change it herself after ab gets here - but that is not likely she is like Judge Vinsonhaler in such things - If you and Enid should decide to come home as any time you would have your own beds as always.

Mrs Spurlock to bring her ukp the bill after she has had her time to do things in her own way I surely am grateful to you for making her feel welcome here I thoroughly appreciate that, Darling. The garden looks so good I feel as though I had received a great big present. Mr Deer berry has worked 2 solid days^so far (he is still working) <del>and five hours</del> to clean it all up - and he is a strong man. So many thanks to you again I had to have Alice go to the dentist for 2 fillings - one pretty deep cavity. he has put temporary filling in it. 
We are all feeling a lot better this evening - it is cooler Hope you are too. God! I shrink from she thought of the heat you stand 
Loads of Love, Mona.
