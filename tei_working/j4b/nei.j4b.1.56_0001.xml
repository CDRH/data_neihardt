Crow Agency, march 13.'18. 
Dear Ones:-
I have a great piece of news. I told you about Curly, the famous Crow scout, who was the only survivor of the Custer fight. 
Well, a little while ago he hunted me up again, brought with him an Indian who could speak English. He said he wanted to say: "I want us to be friends always, & when I am in trouble maybe I aks you waht to do & you tell me." I had a cheap silver ring that I picked up at Santa Fe for $1. He took my hand & said: "I give you my ring & you give me yours, then we think of eachother while we live" Lord! but didn't that move me! Stern, dignified, beautiful old cuss! And to think that I who am to write "The Song of the Sioux <unclear/>" should wear Curly's ring! It looks like a first influence, & who knows that the ring won't in some way give me influences? 
The ring has a cow's head on it, it's on my ring finger. He wore it on his huge little finger. 
Much love to you all! How happy I'll be to get home! Jno
