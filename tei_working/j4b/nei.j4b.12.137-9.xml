Dearest Daddy:
Well, I've bene to see Bring the lsited the place at 6000, and say he <del>quite sure</del> was no reason why he shouldn't sell it before fall. He says he's had a number of people admire the place and am who owned it. He wants 5% if he sells it, so if he gets $6000, you'll get your $5700 clear. All his business he does through the bank here. If he wakes a call, sittin the deal, or he can do it and and you are itemized account. How does that all sound?
We're quite comfortable and I <unclear/> happy here. It's very hot and very very dusty, but at that not unbearable at all. Danny is an angel, as he always has been, and the cat is just a cat.
