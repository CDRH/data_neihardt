Dear Lulu:-
I do hope that when you have gotten over the operational which can't take better than you have for a long time. Tonsils can do all sorts of <unclear/> when they are bad. 
I suppose you'd rahter hear something new than to have folks talking about your sickness. The nervest thing here is the State Teachers' Convention at Omaha. I was on twice last Thursday, <unclear/> at the High School auditorium afternoon <figure/> The big municipal auditorium which seats 10,000. 
In the forenoon I surely made a billing. They actually called me back after discussing the technique of poetry for over an <del/>. hour I'm told that no one else was called back. 
In the afternoon I had nearly 2,000 teachers, tho' there were less than 5,000 in all, & 10 other meetings at the same time. 
The main auditorium is a voice-killer. No one ever gets a cross very well. Toft, called it "This voice <unclear/> place of yours". 
I yelled at the top of my voice for '42 hrs.

It seems that over half heard me. had I been speaking outdoors, I could have been heard a city block away. It was awful. But it was really successful, for over one-third of the conversation came to hear me, tho' 10 other meetings were going on; & many were angry, I am told, because I was just in such a place to speak. No other place, however, would have held the people - except Boyd Theatre, & that wasn't used by the Convention.

The school edition seems to be doing well. Looks good. Have nearly finished my history. Will be through with it this month. 
I do hope you are going to feel better soon and it is reasonable to suppose that you will. 
Lots of love to all four of you. 
Jno.
