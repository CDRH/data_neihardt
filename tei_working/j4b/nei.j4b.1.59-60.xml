                <p>I do hope that when you have gotten over the operational which can't take better
                    than you have for a long time. Tonsils can do all sorts of derailment when they are bad.</p> 
                <p>I suppose you'd rahter hear something new than to have folks talking about your
                    sickness. The nervest thing here is the State Teachers' Convention at Omaha. I
                    was on twice last Thursday forenoon at the High School auditorium afternoon. The big municipal auditorium which seats 10,000.</p> 
                <p>In the forenoon I surely made a billing. They actually called me back after discussing the technique of poetry for over an <del/>. hour I'm told that no one else was called back.</p> 
                <p>In the afternoon I had nearly 2,000 teachers, tho' there were less than 5,000 in
                    all, &amp; 10 other meetings at the same time.</p> 
                <p>The main auditorium is a voice-killer. No one ever gets a cross very well. Toft,
                    called it "This voice killing place of yours".</p> 
                <p>I yelled at the top of my voice for '42 hrs.</p>

                <p>It seems that over half heard me. had I been speaking outdoors, I could have been
                    heard a city block away. It was awful. But it was really successful, for over
                    one-third of the conversation came to hear me, tho' 10 other meetings were going
                    on; &amp; many were angry, I am told, because I was just in such a place to
                    speak. No other place, however, would have held the people - except Boyd
                    Theatre, &amp; that wasn't used by the Convention.</p>

                <p>The school edition seems to be doing well. Looks good. Have nearly finished my history. Will be through with it this month. 
                I do hope you are going to feel better soon and it is reasonable to suppose that you will.</p> 
                <salute>Lots of love to all four of you.</salute>
