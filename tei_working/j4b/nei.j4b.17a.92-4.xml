Hilda Darling:
<p>I am sending you a letter which please return to me. I Know you are really interested - Am writing to Mr Ellis Ellis today - so pray for me! The Lamp is ready for Daddy who expects to start the rubber mold today.</p>
<p>We are still living on Thanksgiving left overs - This is <underline>fact</underline>.</p>
<p>Would you like to plan to come home for your dear birthday, bringing Millie, Alice and Albert? I would love that and could have your cake made here instead of sending one to you there. Of course this depends on your good Albert - so please find</p>

<p>out and let me Know ahead of time. As for Xmas, can't we celebrate it the Sunday after? that would be jsut as good for us.</p>
<p>I am eager to hear for whom you are singing and what you sing. Lily Ponse was wonderful last night on the Ford! God what a difference -! How about your going to her? instead of Crooks? Please tell me what you think. the Neihardt Programs seem to be nearing on the Horizon and you must be ready when they approach to take <underline>your</underline> place.</p>
<p>Am not yet starting my gorgeous dress but hope to soon. Am finishing the comforters first - Endless love and devotion to my Hilda from Mutti.</p>
