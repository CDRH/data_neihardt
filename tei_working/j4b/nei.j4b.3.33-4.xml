Dear Mama:-
My other letter to all of you tells some things about Lulu, but I forgot to tell about her studying the art of movie-writing. She is taking a course with the Palmer school of Los Angeles in scenario-writing, & is doing well. She hopes to be able to make something to help Donald out. They still owe $900 on their place & it's a dickens of a grind to keep up there.

establishment. I really believe Lulu may make a go of it. She has had some reason to be encouraged. donald <unclear/> her about it, but so glad just the same. Lulu says that, from the first, she has thought of trying to but "Three Friends" across in teh movies. Wouldn't it be bully if we could be <unclear/> in this way! 
I hope your carnival will work out big, & I think it will. I told Lulu all about your activities & she was greatly interested, of course. Lots of love, Mama.
