Sunday a.m. Dear Mama:-
You are the first to get a letter on my new stationary! -cold downpour. No doubt you are getting at it too. I guess Fall has begun. 
We <unclear/> to run down Friday forward to it. We know a lot of places to show you up here. Have been all over the city, I think; yesterday p.m. we went to Doling Park & Zoo Park-five quiet places & beautiful. 
I wish Frogge were ready to buy in Branson now. I'd be willing to make him a bargain offer on my place, for I've found a really advantageous property on South Campbell Raod that

exactly suits us all and would be a fine investment undoubtedly. Since Frogges plan to live in Branson, they can't beat our place
The South Campbell house is new has seven rooms & a full Basement, half acre of land right in the path of the spreading city, and the road is paved with <unclear/>. Often country in front! Very beautiful & homelike. There's a big second story sleeping porch (all glass) raised above the rest of the house. We saw it cost evening, the price (cash) is $5000!! If I could get $2000 down on my peace, the rest could run. Or $1500 might be enough

We have been seeing places that would be fine for you - nice to live in and good investments. 
I told you that Dickey & Ellis wanted me to run up to K.C. to talk over a new Dickey gathered that the Post-Dispatch wants me - which way be true I said I'd prefer a proposition by letter, but would go up if absolutely necessary. Not time to hear yet.
Love, 
Jno.
