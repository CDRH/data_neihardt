THE ORDER OF BOOKFELLOWS
<underline>Today</underline>
Dear Ollie:
<p>Glad you don't want the washer, altho washing with at as far easier than you might suppose; and I'd have helped.</p>
<p>I prefer the basement, nice snug place to wash and entirely out of the way.</p>
<p>I <underline>want</underline> to bring the dynamo etc., and I don't need <underline>two</underline> outfits. What the hell good is the stuff here? Do you <underline>really</underline> want it? That's all I want to know.</p>
<p>I'm thinking &amp; scheming a good share of the time on the farm possibility, and I'll probably succeed in landing something. It's <underline>got</underline> to happen</p>
<p>Bully article on Finger. He lived on almost fabulous life before he settled down.</p>
Endless love
Dad
