Dear Miss Piper: 
The beautiful, dainty gift you sent little Alice surely was welcome and made me see you so vividly! Mother exclaimed "Just like Miss Piper." and indeed it was! 
Now you do not know how often I think 
of you and how many times mother and I wish for you to be here. 
Mr Neihardt has gone to California and while he is away the children sit around our little dining room table and color with crayons by the hour, while I try to an-

swer some of my much neglected friends letters. Alice sleeps and laughs and "goo-goos" at us and I do wish you could see her!

Mother is working into the commu-nity here in just the right way. she is President of the Parent's teachers association in town. and we are looking to her for all manner of improvements-and our school really needs improvements. I ahve not held my violin in my hand once <unclear/> I left Bancroft-yet I feel I shall soon do so again, but - I'll never find a miss Piper

to help me out agian, I know that! 
The kills are covered with beautiful yellows and bronzer, and I have a real Japanese painting so marvel at every morning from my bedroom window, an ever changing scene that break away shiny I know of our canvas! 
Please write me when

you feel like it. I am so glad that you like your work this year. 
Ever cordially,
Mona Neihardt.
