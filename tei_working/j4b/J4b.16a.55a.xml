Dear Mama, 
<p>I received the costume and it is really lovely. I am sure it will fit me perfectly when I get it on. Here is the difficulty, however, Due to the shortness of the zipper, and the built in pants, which make it impossible to slip it on over the head, it is simply impossible to get on over my hips. I'm sending a longer zipper with the costume. Will you please put this in place of the one these now? Also, please split the pants so I can get them on. Let Max try it on to see if it is open enough to get into.</p>
<p>The costume itself is <underline>plenty</underline> big - I can tell by looking at it, but I simply cannot get it on, see? Also would you mind putting a little wider straps of perhaps the same material on the costume? This would make it more practical.</p>
<p>Thanks <underline>so</underline> very much Mama. It is a beautiful job of sewing and an adorable costume. I'd appreciate it loads if you'll make the necessary changes for me and send it back as soon as possible. I'd like it for rehearsals.</p>
<p>We're all fine here. I'll write more later.</p>
<p>We're starting work on recital. Thrill thrill!</p>
Loads of love 
to Everyone,
Dear People,
Alice
