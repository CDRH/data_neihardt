This Morning
Dear Ollie:
<p>Many thanks for another good letter, and the more so since you didn't "owe" it. Yours and Enot's letters about the jewelry overpaid me. If anything should go wrong with any of the trinkets, send to the factory for repair. I doin't really expect any trouble, however. I've just complete another stick-pin - ruby on citrine mounted in silver, so that the mounting is not visible when the pin is worn. This will be for Sig, but I may break it in for him.</p>

<p>Macmillans are pushing ahead industriously - the cover being complete and page proofs due any time now. I've read galleys. The copyright says: "Published September, 1941."</p>
<p>I am rather up in the air just now, but secretly, so far as I myself am concerned, I feel completely satisfied. My life could end now, and there'd be a complete pattern.</p>
<p>It's good to feel how Enat is feeling about the Wub and how you back her with the dearest sort of backing in a man's world. We not, such things and appraise them more highly then you are likely to realize.</p>
<p>Love to you and old lady Enot, the Big Fat!</p>
Dad.
