And tomorrow we are going to have a lesson about "Theodore Roosevelt

It has been a little cold here but it hasn't snowed yet. 
Grandma's sistern was leaking and she had to have "Mr Easterday" come and fix it, and when he went down into the sistern. "What do you think he found! he found that the bottom of it was made of cotton rock and didn't even have any cement on it
