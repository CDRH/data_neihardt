Dear Mama!
<p>I did not say in the other card how glad <underline>I'd</underline> be to have one of the Sea Nymphs. I am in such a rush half the time that I don't know what have or have not answered.</p>
<p>Just spoke to Maxie. We plan now (indefinitely) to practise tomorrow evening! This eve. they are going to hear E. Rocht. Schmitz and Albert &amp; I go dancing. I have a lesson today.</p>
<p>My throat has been in perfect shape!</p>
<p>Much love to you and to Daddy.</p>
