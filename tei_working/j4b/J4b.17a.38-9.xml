Dear Oddie &amp; Enot:
<p>Looks as tho' we might drive up and hitch one of these days - probably a week from todya. Mama &amp; I will do the housework, and I'm a heluva fine scrub - lady etc. Enot can <unclear>shtand</unclear> on her bottom and keep the Wub happy. I want to cast a lot of Mama's things. We've learned about flexible rubber molds, and it's almost miraculous. I expect to use liquid marble</p>
39
<p>for most of the pieces. The basement will make a bully work shop. Only a table needed.</p>
<p>Bovard wrote in a most friendly fashion saying he'd say anthing &amp; make it strong. I think he has written Melleth, who will use me, <underline>he says</underline>, when an opportunity arises.</p>
<p>The <unclear>defuen</unclear>e (?), program is in a pitiful <unclear/> state, as anyone could easily <unclear>surmise</unclear>.</p>
<p>Hurrah for the energetic Wub! Gaki is going to be tickled to see it &amp; let it piss on his lap!</p>
Endless love to both
Dad
