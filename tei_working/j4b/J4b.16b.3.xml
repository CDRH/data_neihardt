Dear Old Sig:
<p>Your Shippensburg letter has just been fowarded here, and so was considerably delayed. What you say about the way you have been feeling and feel now over the sudden plunge into a strange world is no news to me. I've felt it with you <underline>very keenly</underline> Sig; and I've had something of the "lost" feeling too - a lot if it at times.</p>
<p>Just the same, <underline>this is the road</underline>, and it will not lead away from your goal. I have deep admiration for the honest - to - goodness guts you reveal in taking the plunge and in making a go of the necessity. You should feel pride in that as a <underline>real achievement</underline> and now that you can get at the piano again, you'll find your soul that seemed lost.</p>
<p>I'm up against a tight squeeze, and I don't see very far. At the moment, but it will all come out well enough as usual.</p>
<p>I do love you and believe in you, Sig.</p>
<p>Be seeing you soon.</p>
Dad
