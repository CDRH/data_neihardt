My dear girl-
Here I come again armed with an apology as usual. - And this time it is the Carnival. We are all head over heels in it. School has started out in fine shape altho not yet in the New building. We had a cornerstone laying, I mean the P.T.a did. It was a very successful affair and we all feel very hapy about it. We were out to Garner's graping last Sunday and I am a miserable wretch again, a dose of ticks, the likes of which I never had before and that it paying something. I am a little more com-fortable tonight. I have a school girl, very nice and quiet and very tidy in her room, (or your room) I like her very much. I wonder how you like your school bud if you have found congenial friends, I hope so sp. <del/>

John starts for the East a week from next Friday, don't know yet if he will be in Hastings. You will know it tho.

I forgot to tell you that we are putting the second story on our school house have had a great time raising the money.

I hope I can make over my winter coat I don't want to get a new one this winter I really can't

Dr and Mrs. Mitchel are still sitting in their front yard and I have been with them often and often they ask about you, I laughed when I noted that mother had ordered the dresses longer. Altho they looked just all right the way they were, but going to so large a place and filling so important a position it was better to strike a happy medicine to maintain the dignity required of you or rather expected. Alice walks every place. And is so cute. the children like their school. Hilda is going to a superstition kindergarten and is so happy about it. Mona is picking off her wild grapes tonight I have mine all done I should be over there helping her. And will probably go after while. 
Had a letter from Mrs. Brown today she is still in Bancroft but is very anxious to come down here and I hope she will this fall yet.

you may get very friendly with Mr. Harris, hope he does not inflict him-self on you. 
Tell me all about your schoo and the town and yourself. I know I don't deserve it but do it any way. I must <unclear/> at least two other letters tonight yet so must leave you. My best love to you my dear. and best wishes too. Alice M. Neihardt
