Dear Ollie:
<p>Can you let Alice have $10 until our next trip East the end of April and the first week of May? I'll be grateful of you if you can.</p>
<p>Essentially, everything is going finely. I'm constantly being surprised at the way <underline>Jed Smith</underline> surges ahead, and I'm eager to get up early every morning to hear more of a tale that certainly seems wise than I am. Macmillans are certainnly eager for it, and ,at the <underline>least</underline> calculation, the preliminary publication of <underline>Jed</underline> in the Spring of '41 and Cycle within a year there after will give us a somewhat better grip. But I am going ahead with a joyous absence of hope that is a thrilling experience.</p>
<p>it is fine to be approaching the end of a long task, and I know a way , if I am forced to take it, that will solve the problems of the family until I am through.</p>
With love.
Dad
