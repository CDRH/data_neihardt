Dearest Max, 
Am in such an awful rush - this this "excuse" for a letter! Card's ^are no good! Had tiresome trip yesterday from Fulton MO. to man-hattan via K.C. Mo. an average of 58 m.p.h. y, was a "have-to" case, & was very cautious: no more speedin' like that thank goodness! I love & miss you always, Sig.
