Dear Mama: - 
I've just seen an article fromthe Omaha Daily news for Nov 17, in which it is stated that you have given the bust to the Omaha Public Library. 
That was surely a noble gesture, Mama! 
Hurrah for you! I note they quote from your letter, & hat you say is bully! 
Long tells me the news sluffed this over prematurely no matter. It's bully! 
Lots & lots love, 
Jno.
