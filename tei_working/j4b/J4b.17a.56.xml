Dear Ollie and Enot:
<p>This is only a note to say that we are thinking of you and the Wub with warm hearts. I keep seeing the little boy's face, and it <underline>gives</underline> me a tickly thrill inside. I do hope it may not be too long before we can see him again and pet him.</p>
<p>We do love you three, separately and collectively Love us back, as I'm sure you do.</p>
<p>The precious little cuss! I keep seeing him.</p>
Dad
