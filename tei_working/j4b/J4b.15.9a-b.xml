My dear Mrs Holm-
Indeed you must not feel you are bothering us - for we do ap-preciate waht you are doing. 
I am going to send you more facts on those Bancroft days as soon as I can get them down properly - and John is sending you his MS "Shows in the Wind" which contains a very few of his finest, critical essays published in the Post Dispatch. All of them would fill many books. - <del/> He is one half critic - that is why he writes slowly. 
This is but a note, will write later 
Sincerely Mona Neihardt.
