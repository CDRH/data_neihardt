My Dear Mrs. Berg:
This is my last Sunday in Buffalo and I am celebrating it with a letter to you, your last letter was so sweet and understanding, that I felt it my turn to wonder why I should have added to my list one who so thoroughly appreciates every thing almost to a fault. I assure you my letters cannot possibly ^be of more delight to you than yours are to me. My dear old father, who has long since been called to the beyond, would say, "I'm afraid you two have kissed tho blarney stone."

Poor Mrs. Grace. I wish she would get busy reading along psychic lines, things open up and one does not ful or. have that feeling of being left. I am going to give you the subjects of some of their things I have been reading along that line and coming from one who has really no right to an independant opin-ion, I find some things very illuminating, of course you know Mrs. Berg; That one most have psychical development, some have the natural gift such as mediums and from them I have had wonderful experiences the last few weeks the time this morning is too limited to give you much about it One of them told me about my mother, told me I would get a letter telling me I must go to her and he talked to my father who said to her tell Alice, she asked who

is Alice? I had never seen her she had no way of throwing my name and in the characterists manner of my father, told the medium I must go to mother she needs you and the next day I recieved the letter from my sister in Grinnell Iowa with whom my mother lives "to come soon as you can easily as mother is failing everyday. And that is what has changed my winter plans, and here are some of the things, I will get down that have helped me altho I still feel that my walls psychicall are very thick. But it is an ever present delight to have even what I have, I am understanding of Psychic forces. our believing of disbelieving does not change the great laws that have always existed.
