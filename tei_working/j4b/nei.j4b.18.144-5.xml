Thursday afternoon
[July 25, 1942]?
Dearest Mama and Daddy!
<p>We were all so happy to get your dear letters - it is almost like seeing you. I am very glad you are "strong and healthy".</p>
<p>Maxie and I "flew around, <unclear>Jertie</unclear>" first thing this morning and did our ironing, etc. Now we can do restful things this afternoon. I have been doing Albert's and my washing here, for nothing is dirty, and the laundry is amazingly hard on clothes. (Details for you, Mama!) I am quite a mender now and can iron quite well, too. I even put cuffs on Albert's new trousers, this could not be done by the tailor. When we went to the last Curtiss party, many people remarked about Albert's beautiful cuffs!</p>
<p>We (Albert and I) are going swimming this week-end with two other young couples. We'll go Sunday for all day.</p>
<p>I practice every day and am, of course, making headway with the piano. It is</p>

<p>quite fun, as well as a satisfaction. Mr. Gerak is still out of town.</p>
<p>Maxie weighed Pansy seeds for me yesterday - six pounds, by the ounce! That is a real job. I got a <strike>nice</strike> shipment of seeds, and they will be sold in a jiffy.</p>
<P>As you may have guessed, we did not sell the ring. Albert does not want to give it away to any "thieves." We were afraid we'd be very sorry if we sold it for so little.</P>
<p>It is rather hot here, but we have such a fine breeze coming in our big front windows. We have not really suspect much so far.</p>
<p>We had a card from Alice today.</p>
<p>Mama, we'll be happy to help you in any way possible with your pieces. We hope you can get a real start with them.</p>
<p>Now I must get at some of the things there are for me to do. I'll write more soon.</p>
Much love as always to you two and to Amama
Hilda
<p>Albert says to say nice things for him!</p>
<p>What about Mr. Baker and our pictures?</p>
