Dearest Lulu; how I wish you could be here at the date this invitation says. I think it will be lovely. Mona and I are going, we have been having such horrid winter weather - so cold and the snow so deep - I have not been to church for three Sundays. Soon we will be into the short month and then I mak my trip back to Brnason and I'll be so glad to get there this has been a hectic winter, but I have tried and have been oil on the troubled waters. many times but I need to get away from it all, they are all lovely to me. Lovingly Mama.
