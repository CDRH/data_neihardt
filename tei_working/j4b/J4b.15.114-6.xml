Dear Enat and Oddie:
<p>Hurrah for honest-to-god cheese and anchovies! And thanks a million for remembering me on Dad's day.</p>
<p>I was interested in all you had to say about affairs at the P.D! They may well shift around and give you a boost, Ollie. Here's hoping they do! And how I'd like to hear of meek being advanced too. Of you get a good chance tell him I've heard rumors of the possibility and am praying for the best after my pagan fashion.</p>
<p>We had a fast &amp; good trip - 2168 miles. Lovely time, too. Will be out again July 5th and than quite a bit until July 27. May then go to Bison, S.D., Enat. You know the place. Hiddy &amp; Alice may show you the letter</p>
116
<p>now there, strikes me as a sweet sort of homely experience.</p>
<p>Am working again today. Incidentally, I found something I may work over to make a <unclear/> him for you, Enat - to go with the earrings and the ring too.</p>
<p>Endless love to both of you!</p>
Dad.
