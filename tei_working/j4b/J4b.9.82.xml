Branson, U.S.A.!!
Listen - my darling, Where have you been all my life? I missed you so last nite! 
I hope you had a fine time up 'ta the contest, show etc. 
Hope to see you soon!
Got any ideas? This depression is so unbearable  - I just feel worse than a "half-cent stamp"! (Loafin', you know) Roselle is shoeing "Ribbon" - I don't know when we'llhave her back! 
Love, your S.N.
