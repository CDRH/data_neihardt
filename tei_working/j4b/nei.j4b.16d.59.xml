ass, 1940.
Dear Ollie:
<p>I've cut the hedge slips, which, as I learn from a govt. report, must be last years wood. There are two bundles, and when the slips are cut to about 9 inches, there shoudl be around 100 of them - maybe more. The bundle are buried, according to govt. specificatious, and I'll fetch them whenever we come.</p>
<p>Also, maybe I'd better have the leg fastening's ready with the legs to be screwed on. How far down will the sides of the top came - far enough to hide 3 inche stuff?</p>
With sentiments of
highest steam,
Dad
