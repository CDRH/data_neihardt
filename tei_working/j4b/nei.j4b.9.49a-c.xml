Perhaps I have your name mispelled. 
Also excuse the stationary.
Aug. 17th - '31,
Dear Maxine,
I did not know whether or not it seemed very polite of me to pick you up this morning without even introducing myself to you! I didn't stop to think that you didn't know my name, as I had heard from Hilda that you & she knew each other in school! However, my name is Sigurd (or "Sig" for short)! 
Now that I have graduated from Ranken Auto & School of Mech. Grades in St. Louis,

I am back to the "old times" of good hard piano practice! Several years ago I was a pupil of Mrs. Hayes of the "S. of D" but since then I've sudied in SD. Louis under a pupil of Paderewki (I guess you know of him). Due to this, a fellow is more or less enslaved to regular practice, to keep from for - getting etc. <unclear/> before my afternoons as a rule are composed of practicing! (Not always but nearly always).
I hope this letter doens't sound as if I were trying to impose on you!

I have heard many com-pliments about you being the msot polite operator we've had in Branson! This note is becoming too long, I'm sure! 
I dont' want you to think that I'm "chasing" you as some fellows might do, but I just naturally have respect for a girl who is decent & so attractive I coudln't keep from noticing you! 
Sincerely,
Sig Neihardt.
"Number Please" & "Thank you" 
(Ha!Ha!)
