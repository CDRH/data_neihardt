Dearest Children"
<p>So glad you liked Dads beautiful prayer. It was written for all his grandchildren substituting "boys" for "girls" and vice versa according to who is saying it!</p>
<p>It is sweet to hear Joanie and Elaine reciting it so seriously and with a wrapt look of awe on their faces!</p>
<p>Yes Ollie, the bed arrived in good condition.</p>
<p>I Know you are busy Enid but write as soon as you can do</p>
Your loving old
Mother
