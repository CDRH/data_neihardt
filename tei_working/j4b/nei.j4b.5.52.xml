My dear Enid:-
Where are you? It seems a hundred years since I last heard from my Nebraska girl. You and I were born in the same state. The Lord must have intended that we meet each other some time somewhere. I never see a prairie without thinking of you. Please, Enod, if you have the time send me some word, some sign that you have not forgotten me. 
What has become of the "Little Buffalo"? Travellers bring messages about him but he does send me the wampum. Does he sit in his tent smoking his pipe in silence? Ask him to make a sign.
In the meantime I am 
Yours,
To Enid NEIHARDT.
