                <p>I arrived here at 10:30 last ngiht after a rather exciting trip last week the
                    most destructive storm ever known in these parts swept up the Columbia River. It
                    was sleet, the conducter of our train was burried 22 feet deep in a snow (or
                    rather sleet) slide for 70 hours. the sleet rolled down the steep mountains
                    (that overbang the track) like water, &amp; 45 miles of track were covered from 3 to 70 feet deep along the Columbia. I came up here on the first train out of Portland for a week. Though the drifts had melted much under a warm rain, they were still, in many places, higher than the train.</p>

                <p>I sat in the smoker near the conductor &amp; read his orders as he got then. He
                finished them to a seat in front him. It was <unclear/> to <unclear/> of dangerous
                stretches of track &amp; had budges over tremendous torrents. I didn't feel afraid,
                though, "I will through delays". The ride for 150 miles along the Columbia river was
                wroth a lot of travelling. A staggering morning picture, surely. The famous Columbia
                highway follows the track, &amp; there were 160 cars snowed under in a distance of 50 miles. Many were twenty feet under, I was told. It was good for me to see the Columbia River;</p>

                    up that way on his return from California, after the cumbqua massacre. I saw the

                    called up President Peurose, &amp; he is sending my mail over, so I'm all on my toes waiting to hear from <unclear/>.</p>

                Am feeling especially well this morning. hav ecaught up on sleep, at last.</p> 
                <p>I played a nice truck on the R.r. Co up from Frisco. I could have taken an
                    evening train with two nigths on the way, or a morning train with one night on
                    way. I took the latter, of course, and did not get a pullman <unclear/>, which
                    was $4.85 to Portland. Instead, I waited until bed time &amp; then</p>

                <p>some parts of Oregon are pleasing - more so to me, than California. But there are
                    drawbacks, as I learned. Took hard at the country around Jan there &amp; be sure
                    that fern swore beautiful places expect me in the U.S. as for the winters there,
                    they can't be very bad; &amp; we well learn to stand the heat, I'm sure. Nothing grows wild out here - nothing to eat, I mean. It's a beautiful country, but tight-fisted. And I despise the owrds of Coast. I guess I'm decent. The Coast is bad bad. The women show that they count on sex for everything. Of course, there are good people- hundreds of thousands of them- but they do not set the standards.</p> 
                <p>How I hate brazen femininity! The commonly seen woman's</p>
