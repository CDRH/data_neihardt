Dear Ones:- 
I've been having a wonderful time here yesterday Howard & Mrs. H. drove we all around old Monterey & we explored the whole town. On the way over by the sea we saw four huge sharks & they were within 40 feet of us. I stood at the lip of the sea & took six pictures of them. Could have killed one if I had had a rifle. They were chasing the seals. Last night Sterling came down & today he and 
John Kenneth Turner and Herbert Herron and Howard & Mrs. H. & I went over to Point Lobos & had a <unclear/> time with the ocean. Such surf & such colors! Tomorrow p.m. we go to San Francisco, where I have a visiting card at the Bohemian Club won't stay there long. Go to Berkeley in the evening & back to S. F. Yesterday. My cold is nearly well. Have had a hard time with it. I no longer feel the chill here.

am getting acclimated. It's a heavenly climate. Flowers growing & no night frosts. Golden weather. It's Greece. Sterling is a big Boy. How he knows & loves the sea. He is a faun. Lovable, but not a solid character & no philosopher. He was evidently tickled to see me. I like him tremendously, but he is not deep enough to represent a race. 
Tell Sig about the big shark Daddy saw! 
This is for all
Lovingly
Jno 
I'll be glad to be home. 
Nebraska has charms that this country lacks. This country is not so <unclear/>. Of course, the sea is <unclear/> enough; but the climate isn't.
