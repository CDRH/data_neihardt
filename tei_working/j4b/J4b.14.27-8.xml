Dear Girl:
Arrived at Enot's and Ollie's in good shape. Was in St. James for lunch at 12:30; loafed along and landed at three o'clock. Stayed there last night and came in to Enright this morning. Everyone is well and happy. Have not seen Hiddy yet, but talked to her by phone. Enot's letter is a dear, and no doubt it has a pink bottom, as reported; but it had been fussing around in the basement and was black on its chair-side when I looked it's beastly hot here today, and little air stirring. 
I do hope you're feeling all right. Another night's sleep and I'll feel bully. By the time I reach Branson, I expect to have the light shining inside again. That was a great month - one of the best ever; and I can compare my present and former condition by being in this apartment. I'll be at work soon, I know.

Kiss the naughty girls for Grandans. 
Endless love to all of you
