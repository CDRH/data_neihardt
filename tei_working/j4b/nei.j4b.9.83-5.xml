Wed. Eve; 
"Here"
Sweetheart- 
Got here OK. - "I tell'ya"! Only two flats & every-thing else perfect ex-cept the roads! 
Lots of detours & "S-Curves."
Came thru Bagnell road & saw your dad's car sitting out in the road! He was talkin' to some-one & had a big old smile on his face! 
So you may know that he must be ok. 
His road is all torn up & rough - lots of work to be done yet

Gee! Talk about hot- & we had two flat tires within a few miles of where your father is in the sun! 
I'm mising my sweet girl, but this is only a short trip! 
Dad wants to go out & see a show so I won't have time to write much, & there is nothing to say except that I love you endlessly!! 
Sweetheart! I'll be seeing you soon! 
Hope all's well! 
Love Always,
Your Sig.
