My dear little girl-
Your letter should have been answered days ago-but I have been laboring under a heavy claim of the Flee and not until this morning have I felt the least desire to write to Even you-It was so lovely of you to tell me all about the lovely New building-but you did not say it was named Neihardt, and did they have a program? I was so sorry John could not be there-But he was a guest of the Poetry Society of New York City for a whole week, a great triumph for him-they have at last "let down the bars"- They have had to face the fact

that all good things are not East of the Mississippi river.-It was a great success for John in many ways - they were jjust "bowled over" figuratively speaking when he <del>he</del> read to <unclear/> 
He met celebrities from England and all the best in the East. I was so happy that at last John is one of them by their own acknowledgement-but he would have been happy to be in Wayne-I recieved the package and it is such a body one-just the things I need.-Have just finished a wool rug made from wool rugs and some yarn. for in front of my fireplace, very pretty.-the months are going fast sock it will be time to pack your car and start for the Ozarks-I hope you can manage to be here when John and Mona have their vocation here. love to you dear little girl-lovingly Alice Neihardt
