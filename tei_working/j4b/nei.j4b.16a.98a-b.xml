Enid Darling:
<p>You are good to ask us to visit you - but for the present we <underline>must do nothing</underline> that costs money.</p>
<p>I have "wrestled with the Angel and am now quite able to be happy over our many blessings and not tear myself to pieces with hopeless wishes. - I want to be with you when your Baby comes - and I am praying that I may be allowed to do so - but I must be near Daddy if he has to go to California. Let us not cross any bridges... Maybe every thing will be lovely! It now looks as though we would not leave till August, and maybe later on it will develop that we do not go till September. - Maybe your darling baby will come in the early part of August? Are you certain of the time?</p>
<p>Anyway I already love him or her<strike>e</strike> - and want to be with you.</p>
<p>No do not send that bed - Keep it for occasional visitors upstairs in your <sic>attick</sic> - may be Daddy and I will be using it there some time!</p>
<p>Give my love to our Ollie and tell him we understand how hard his work must nwo be at the Post - but we do want a word from him.</p>
Always loving you devotedly
Mama
Mother
<p>P.S.
Would you like an illunimated copy of your "Lullaby" to hang in your nursery? Please let me Know. M.</p>
