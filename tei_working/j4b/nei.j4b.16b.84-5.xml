THE ORDER OF BOOKFELLOWS
Tuesday noon:
<p>Today for the first time since we sent our stove back have I had warm <unclear/>tern water to wash dishes with - thanks to your dear helpfulness in sending the little stove, for which many thanks - We really <underline>need</underline> it now since it is quite chilly but until now it has been sort of a lark to let Daddy cook out for us every noon adn with Mrs Cantwell's good rang-</p>
85
<p>to bake our bread etc in we have managed quite pleasantly using our electric plate and percolator as well - No use in <underline>writing</underline> any more now since we are planning to drive up Sunday. I am <underline>so</underline> happy! We are well and <underline>very</underline> busy I want to make a Fall coat for Alice this week and she dances, we now think, Saturday evening at the <unclear>Berummity</unclear> Hall here -</p>
<p>Auf baldiges Wiedersehen!</p>
Mother, Mama.
