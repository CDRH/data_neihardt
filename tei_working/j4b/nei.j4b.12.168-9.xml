Dearest Dad: 
In reply to your letter I shall lay that Virginia is going to be here just one more week. Alice and I can easily take care of Mama now. So I guess that settles that! There is nothing to be done now that al and I can't do. 
I am so sorry to hear that <unclear/> job is no good. If he can only get on the radio! Oh, I do so haze he can. You need not worry about my being <unclear/> at what you say. Not that I don't care at all; it is just that I'm not made that way. And my faith in the "all rightness" of the future for us is not, I <unclear/>, <unclear/> childish optimism. It is the belief you expressed when you said you thought they didn't want to "break the pattern". 
My medal is a beauty. I very im-pertinently pinned it on me and warded around with my chest held high! Mama and I are reading the Messiah together, and as I said to Mama, any attempt

at marking outstanding places woudl be a hopeless task. We glory in it together. 
To see the pictures of the five of you was a joy to us all. So think of your being in that ghastly tea kettle is not a pleasant thought. We have hot days - but, to tell the truth I don't mind the heat. Practically all the time I feel almost <unclear/> well. I'm quite sure I have enough energy for two. However, I'm very lazy. 
Endless love 
Hilda
