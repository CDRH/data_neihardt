                <p>Your good letter came weeks ago and was enjoyed as your letters always are-and I had no intention of letting so much time pass before answer-ing it, excuses are foolish and apologizes bad form so here I am just left swinging and I must tell you some of the things that have intervened-swing, lots of it, for the little tots at the other house - which made it possible for Mona to do some sculping and the result is a most wonderfully lie like bust of John - she is just finishing it-tomorrow a photographer will be here <del>tomorrow</del></p>

                <p>photograph it for the frontispiece of his collected poems of which she is now reading proof-the baking swing and so forth is my con-tribulation- I have always been tehre when the Elephant needed watering-then came work in the yard and garden making, house cleaning and we have had some company and are expecting more. But everybody is busy-we are up early as the middle of the day is very warm.-To begin with the other house, they breakfast at six John milks after and goes to his study, Mona goes upstairs to her clay - Enid cleans up downstairs with some help from Grandma</p>

                <p>Sigurd to the garden or town there or at my house, Hilda and Alice ride the horse to water - and the day wears on toward won-Mona down in the time to get dinner or start a washing or some other important stunt that makes for the comforts of the family of six-and I - well I Just felt in any old place so happy that some one needs me yet- all this! and maybe you won't care to know - I would not forget to say that busy as we all are we find time to ^go to our Roark a beautiful creek clear as crystal 3/4 of a mill away and Every one from Baby Alice to Grandma has lots of fun sometimes I cna swim, John says</p>

                <p>am here to there - oh how I wish I could just have you here while my roses are so
                    beautiful such quantities of them, the fences covered, the lattices at the porch
                    are a flame and <del>at</del> the windows are latticed ^&amp;rose covered, Sigurd said this morning - "why Grandma you don't need to cut flowers for the house they run not every where"- but they do not run right because I have spent much time thing" priming and careing for them, so they ^are just where I want them to go, - but as I said I wish you were here to see them-the next morning and the usual stunts performed I loaves of bread and a big pan of rolls very close to the baking stage-a gentler rain the we need</p>

                <p>is giving us all a new lease and I feel just like talking to you all day, - But don't get seared, I won't - I must tell you how proud we are of our Enid, 15 years old the 23rd of next yet, - Last march she heard her daddy say he wished so much he had some one to do his typing, (and she worships her daddy) She said to her mother why couldn't take lessons and be daddie's stenog-rapher?- It was an idea and Mona immediately acted upon it, a teacher was procured, She took such an interest and learned so well, that now she is diong all his typing and very quickly, Daddy says a perfect M.S. this she has done besides her school work and music lessons and she <del/> does very well in both not a prodigy but a normal steady worker</p>

                <p>it makes work so much easier for her father, He <del/> is in no condition to type after he has finished <del/> some things that has taken all of him to do, which is so often- Sigurd is just normal in all his school studies, But in music he is very much more than ordinary I am so glad he has not taken to poetry - I would not want him to have to suffer what Poets do altho a musicians life is like a taut fiddle string most of the time, now I have spirit this time, paper and ink, just bragging about my people but you, have always been such a sympathetic and appreciative listener that I dare to just abuse your patience, remember me to all the Pender friends especially the group I met at the station, extra for the <unclear/>. and love to you and dear self and your Dr.</p> <closer><salute>Sincerely</salute> <signed>Alice Neihardt</signed></closer>
