Dear Hiddy and Alice: 
I was glad for your letter. 
It does seem that you would be better off at home if Mamma is satisfied to let you go. There would be chances to run up and see her, and if there weren't you could go up anyway a couple of times before she comes back. You might tell Mamma that you will go home and get things all in good shape for her coming, and that will give her an idea to hold to. 
If you go to Branson soon, you will have money enough to settle the Yandel bill at once. Your plan for handling the food for the week is good, and I know you will enjoy the game of planning. 
There isn't anything new to say from here--not even that Enid and I love you both, which is true, but old stuff. 
Someone should be watching the place too. 
Love,
Dad

Steno's P. S. I say, kids, have you done any more wild west riding since I left? If you have, I do hope the h-e-ro was not half as dumb looking and acting as the one we saw! -Eny 
Thank Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Henderson too for letting me stay there the other night. It was so nice.
