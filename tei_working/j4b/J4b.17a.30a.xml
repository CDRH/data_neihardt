Dear Mama:
<p>I am so sorry to hear that you too have gotten down sick.</p>
<p>I wrote Maxine last week &amp; told her to please get someone to help do up the hard work, &amp; I'd pay for it.</p>
<p>What is causing so much sickness at Branson? Is it the city water or <strike>or</strike> I wonder what?</p>
<p>Please be careful as can be. I'm terribly busy, but wanted to write anyway &amp; send you my love.</p>
Always I love you,
Sig.
