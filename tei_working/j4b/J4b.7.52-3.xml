Dear Mamma:
Don't worry about the Stock Exchange. I am well protected, and the outlook for the first of the year is very bright, for then a flood of money will come back into the market eager for stocks. This is a bust due to over extension of credit, and is temporary. The Big Boys are shaking <de/> out the little boys and buying their stocks at ridiculous bargains. When the Big Boys get the stocks, then they'll rise fast. Pennsylvania will leap after the first of the year. Some excellent developments are to be disclosed then, and it is so on nearly all my stocks. Even if I sold now at the very low prices, I'd have a profit of over $1,000. But I should easily get an average of seven points more on 400 shares, and on some stocks as much as 25 point rise. It's a bad time, but I'm safe and have only to weather the storm, which I can do nicely. At worst, I could drop Penn.-which I don't expect to do - and own my other stocks outright. Then I couldn't be hurt by anything that could happen. 
I'm sending you a birthday present of the sort <del/> you've never had before. It's a good thing, solid gold and the stone is a real one and a good one. 
Mona, too, has a gift of the sort you never had before, and I think it's a dandy.

I'll send the check for the coke this week. 
The other day, Clark McAdama, who is head editorial writer, sent me a note saying that my Spengler articles were "truly excellent examples of intellectual reporting". I stand well here, sure enough, and could stay on indefinitely, I suppose. But something else will come up, I believe. 
Endless love,
Jno.
The MS of "Straws in the Wind" is all ready to send to MacMillans, save for my reading it over for little errors. It will appear in the spring, I understand. A book of about 250 pages - maybe more.
