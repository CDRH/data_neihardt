Dear Enot:I know you are doing every-thing right, and I'm not even thinking about it. Yes, I told them to get the needed groceries in addition to the five. Yes, pay up the bills. You'll be crowded until the June bills are paid; then it will be easier. I don't need money now - may not need any Am getting on finely. Will send stuff to P-D this Wed., & am askign for 2 wks. vacation after that. O how I hope we can make that trip together. I think we can, unless your prospects work out in a job. 
It would be fun dictating a pronebook to you

The two pieces of the fork are in my desk drawer with the paper, I can have electric welding done here. An inch long piece of the Saidson steel would be sufficient & Dave postage; but I'm afraid Hiddy couldn't find a <del/> good back saw blade to cut it.
