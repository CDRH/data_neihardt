Dear Ollie &amp; Enot:
<p>Thanks for another, fine newsy letter. I'm not replying now - just sending you our sugar cards to be used in getting more <underline>canning</underline> sugar. We cannot use them here for that purpose without permission from our board, and we don't care enough to get the permission. You will be perfectly justified in getting canning sugar for us as a part of your family, as you do not know that we will not be there. So use them &amp; fire them back to us as soon as</p>
-2-
<p>you have used them so that we can get our ordinary supply in a couple of weeks from now.</p>
<p>Everything is lovely. Hello Nei old timer! Spinach, tar, hot do!! You can have our teetch back as soon as Gaki gets some others.</p>
Endless love
Dad
