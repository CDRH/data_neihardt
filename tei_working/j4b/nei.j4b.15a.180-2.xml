Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>You have <underline>made Xmas</underline> for our girls and I do thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>I am sitting in a lovely cabin home - really a beautifull 2 room apartmetn with bath and closet, the N.M. Sunshine on my back and splendid <underline>gas furnance</underline> heat at my feet. I <underline>love</underline> this place and the surroundings are the most beautiful one could dream of having on Earth.</p>
<p>Today we will go out and learn more about the city. I am hoping to find a pottery but may be that is asking to much of destiny.</p>
<p>I am wearing the lovely gift - house coat you two gave me, and it harmonizes with the predominating tones of this charming place.</p>
<p>When Daddy and I started we little dreamed that some day we would be driving our own car and enjoying so love<unclear/> a home as this together! Dad read over his lines</p>
182
<p>this morning and like that great creator <unclear/> the Jews. It was good - so tomorrow we fully expect new lines to matrue. We have over 6 weeks to look forward to and enjoy together!</p>
<p>The great mountain Sandra was all rose colored from the setting Sun last night and today it is partly revealed before a halo of cloud, partly draped with white misty streamers a lovely sight! This camp is at its feet. We would like to build near here if we could buy some land within the Gas limit. There is nothing finer for comfort than this natural gas, and the <underline>new fixtures</underline> exclude all possible danger from bad ari etc.</p>
Loving you devotedly
Your Mom.Mother
