Dear Ollie and Enot:
<p>Many thanks for good letters from you both, and especially for the latest, Ollie. You are obviously right about the review, but only the opening paragraph of the original I sent you was by Rolfs, and I did not notice if that, tto, was cut to fit. I objected to the signature because it would seem to give an air of authority - "<unclear/> of Indiana"! But even that matter not at all. the funny part of it is that Gottlieb read my comment as complimentary. I remaeked that the article <underline>was</underline> "written from the outside". But really, it's just nothing at all. Yes, if they had turned you loose on the job, you would have done a really holding</p>

<p>article. Mama &amp; I spoke of that.</p>
<p>I've been collecting the largest walnuts I could find, hulling them by hand; and they are now drying in the backyard. Also have a peck and a half of hickory nuts. These are to be divided when the girls &amp; Albert haul them up to St. Louis. Nei will enjoy sitting up with his Dad and cracking nuts during the long winter evenings, after he has managed, at last, to get his Mama to bed. Is he having any serious Mama trouble yet? Mamas can be so unreasonable with men, making them wash their feet and faces at impossible times, and all such debbrate annoyances. But Mamas are kind of nice, anyway.</p>
<p>Mona is going to Springfield with a neighbor today.</p>
Love always,
Dad
