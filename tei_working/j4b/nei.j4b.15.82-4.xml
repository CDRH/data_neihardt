Dear Ollie:
<p>Delighted to hear from you - and especially good news too! Can you do Beery's job without leaving the P.D? I hope so. It might lead to something else. Sounds good, and it's decidedly up your alley. You <underline>might</underline> start something you haven't in mind yet.</p>
<p>We have a Chicago agent now for Chicago &amp; <unclear>vicinity</unclear> - the agent up there. It seems that Walter Hergbun will accept agency for Coast lectures. So says Idwal Jones. We should know soon. We're about to get the agent in San Francisco, if Hergbun doesn't come over.</p>
<p>Sig has done remarkably well so far $2245 contracted - half of which engagements have now been filled. Of course, there's considerable belated start. In addition to above the outlook is apparently excellent, still, I'll need a lot of cash, have spent a <underline>lot</underline> since August last.</p>

<p>Jed " is surgery along still at the rate indicated in my recent note to you and old Enat-Peanut. The damned thing, seems to have a life of its own! Macmillan wanted to make a dummy for fall season publication, but it will appear in Jan-Feb-March next year, as I planned. Unless, of course, some accident happens. Wish I could hide away, forget the goddamn stuff they call money (monkey sh --!) and surge on through to the and of the narrative! But I'll go through anyway - so what?</p>
<p>Good God! You should see our place. <underline>Beautiful!</underline></p>
Love as always, 
<underline>Dad.</underline>
<p>Geo. sends regards to Mitzi.</p>
