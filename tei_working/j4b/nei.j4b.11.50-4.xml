Thursday.
My own dearest Enid.
Yesterday at 10 minutes to twelve o'clock Grandma passed out. I have the pleasure of remembering that I was up with her the very last night - and that she knew me before she died and the belief that she will come back to me when she gets ready - All this is real to me - the fact that Grandma is leaving her property to "the girls" who this and that - is real to every one else - and so everything is O.K. 
The consciousness that

things were not as she wanted at the last was torture to Grandma-too bad - but that is all over now - and I feel very much re-lieved. Last night I slept well - for the first time in weeks. 
You shoudl see how beauti-ful Grandma looks in her last resting place - She is having every-thing done just as she wanted - Lu is even more "thingy" than Grandma-
Daddy is going ot meet us in Kansas City where the creamtion will take place - Sigurd will drive us up in the

Packard. 
Grandma's <del>remains</del> <unclear/> stands in her front room, under her double windows that over look her rock garden. 
Alice is at home, not want-ing to go to school - and I am writing to you my own dear, dear Enid. 
Daddy said he had had 2 dear letters from you - I wish he could circle the job you spoke of for you in Omaha for next year - however you are getting an education where you are, and an experience which will in every way benefit you. Be- 

54
sides you have still to meet Bob Davis - who may change the whole outfool there at Munsey's for you - So do your best and all else will come. 
My own dearest Enid I love you deeply and sin-cerely, to say nothing of lov-ing you as a Mother alone loves her babies - 
Mama.
