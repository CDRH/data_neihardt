Dear Enid-
Recieved the note and its contents as usual saying many Thanks - this will be just a note as I am going to hear the Messiah this afternoon with one of Aunt Lora's neigh-bors - It is given at the college chapel. The ground is White with snow and is quite coll altho not freezing - I am wondering how it is down home, Enid dear I think I left water in the allunium pail. I emptied the one pail and turned it upside down on the stove - what have you been doing dear, you say you are not working on your rug. I have sent Auntie Grace's to her - It was very pretty. Aunt Lora had roast duck for dinner today Myrtle and I washed the dishes 

and then I came up stairs and had my nap - till mama my Birthday box arrived G.K. and is safely tucked away in my closet - I am sending a little box to Branson which of course you will take care of until Christmas I wonder if I have told you that I am wearing my new garters and they are fine, I surely have told mama but I can't remember - I must write to Auntie Grace today and will just say I lov eyou always the <unclear/>. I had such a nice letter from Mrs. Garner. I am so glad to hear from I am happy here - they are all so nice. And I do just what I want to I get up when Aunt Lora and Uncle Jim do and eat breakfast at 6 Every morning. - I am going to fix my brown silk dress this week, loads & loads of love to you Enid dear from Grandma,
