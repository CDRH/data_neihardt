Dear Ollie, Enot and Nei:
<p>Thanks for reminding me about the draftboard. I was mailing a letter when yours came; but I might have forgotten. In fact, I remembered with a shock. I'm scart of officials, and I registered the letter.</p>
<p>The weather is heavenly, and has been, I hear, for two weeks or more. There had been no rain for ten days when I arrived, but, funnily enough, that evening there was a pleasant little rain with friendly thunder. The signs seem to indicate the beginning of the dry season here. Everything has grown enormously here. I've been cleaning up flower gardens. The roses are getting ready to bloom again, &amp; I gave them a dose of vitamins yesterday. The hollyhocks must have made a great show, but they're going now.</p>
<p>You should see the foliage on our place. Golly, it has become truly beautiful.</p>
<p>Amama has gained a great deal, &amp; she seems almost happy. Of course, she will fly as soon as she gets enought steam up.</p>

<p>Not that birds fly with steam! I was just being mildly literary! I was not!</p>
<p>George feels prosperous with all his family about him again, except the little girls. He is sure they are "just around the corner." He shows mcuh affectionate admiration for Amama. They really liek each other.</p>
<p>Miss Bachmer has complete her novel. Mama is reading it aloud, and it's a good job.</p>
<p>I think much of you three, and often I find myself moving about your place &amp; seeing everything very vividly.</p>
With love for all three,
Dad.
<p>Hello, Nei! This is Gaki! Such a good boy!</p>
<p>If you haven't poured the cast yet, fill to the neck, then fuss around ears, nose &amp; eyes with a soft stick of some sort - and then pour the remainder.</p>
