<p>Your card seems to indicate you are happy and busy too. Mr and Mrs Plank have been here and we had a wonderful visit - they are so <underline>dear</underline>! Last weekend was simply heavenly. Had you been with us it would have been too good for this Earth.</p>
<p>Please greet your counsellors friend who was born on August 3rd for me! I am sure you will have a "marvellous" Summer!</p>
<p>Daddy does think for you dear - and pray! I am sure you will succeed in every way. You must have thought it fun to be examined for swimming!! Tell us all about it.</p>

<p>it on to you. The drum left <strike>and</strike> a few hours after your request for it arrived here by <underline>pre</underline>paid Express, valued at $50.00. You should receive it Thursday evening or Friday morning. Let us hear it you wan the other Indian things.</p>
<p>Dr Plank and his youngster son Stever, may drop in on you, as they are planning a walking trip in the "Smokies" this August. They were so interested in all you are doing, Planks were! Mrs Plank may come down here and stay with us a while to learn how to <sic>bak</sic> bread and can fruit etc! She says she never had a chance to learn.</p>
<p>We are so eager to hear more from you - and in the meanwhile please Know that we love you devotedly</p>
Mama.
