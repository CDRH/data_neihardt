Dearest Children:
No one knows how much I want to see you all three right now! We expect to stay here till Daddy finishes the Messiah, unless he gets Chadron, so please end mail here till you are otherwise informed. 
This morning a young girl typist is coming to our cmap to do Dad's Post-Dispatch work! So you see what you are worth to him in dollars and cents, that I cannot be.-We went to the movie here, Bank night and saw a nice looking woman, in print dress and cotton stockings receive $825.00 in cash - can you believe it? She is evidently a country woman and Oh! I am so happy for her! Just think what that much money

<unclear/> do to make her able to help all around! I hope she has at least a big a family I have an that she can do as much. to make her youngsters and husband feel good as I would do, had I been the lucky person! -
Before we left Wayne Mrs Conn had Dr Conn write to Mr Mac Eachan, they call him Alex Governor's best friend and helper.- I so much in hopes he has not yet gotten a stenographer, Enid dear. But what is best, will be. Alice dear how are the Lilies? No such pool as ours in all of Wayne!
Hilda please don't neglect writing me about your clothes and dentist. 
Loads of Love from 
Mother. 
Am sending things for your dress Hilda, and a bracelet Daddy picked out for you Enid, and some-thing I thought woudl be better than a hair ribbon by you, Alice.
