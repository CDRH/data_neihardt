                <p>I thought of you last night at the dinner at the Biltmore Hotel and wished you were
                there. It would have given you a big kick. The brilliant crowd of diners filled the
                huge &amp; gorgeous dining room. There were famous men &amp; women from both England
                &amp; America. I was the guest of honor &amp; sat at the right hand of the President
                of the Society. The guest table was raised <del/> four feet above the floor. I as
                honor guest, did the closing stunt, &amp; it was a big success. I held a big reception afterward - people crowded up - famous, many of them..</p>

                <p>Ernest Rhys editor of Everyman's Library, a fine old British scholar, was by me.
                    Mrs Corinne Roosevelt Robinson came up &amp; said: "I am Theodore Roosevelt's
                    sister, &amp; I want to say that you two should have <unclear/> each other. He
                    was fond of your poetry &amp; introduced your work to me." Later she said: "I'm sure he is with you."</p> 
                
                <p>Old Edwin <unclear/> rushed up tome, cooking like, a god from Olympus, &amp; said: "Is this John Neihardt! Well you're the one man in America I want to meet". Mrs. Markhams said: "you made them all love you." and some other famous person said: "you had them in your vest pocket every minute."</p>

                <p>It was really a triumph, &amp; I met many who have cared for my work for years. I was surprised at the strong undercurrent of reputation I have. I am to read over WOR Friday A.m at 10 or thereabouts-just a short reading-maybe you can get me. It doesn't matter, though, unless it's easy to pick me up.</p> 
                <p>The President of the National Society for American Speech spoke very
                    enthusiastically about my enunciation &amp; <unclear/> &amp; the way I manipulated my syllables, that's her specialty.</p> 
                <p>Lennox Robinson, head of the Dublin Theater, was near me at the guest table. Leonora Speyer was at my right.</p>

                <p>All this seems fine, but I'd rather be with you in Branson. Very much neither. I'm to lunch with <unclear/> tomorrow. He wrote me that sooner or later, when there is a vacancy, I'd be considered for a <unclear/> on the Macmillan staff.</p>
                <p>I can't see yet, have anything much will come of this, but it seemed the thing to do.</p> 
                <p>Oh I wish I could spend some weeks resting with you &amp; watching the spring come on that clean beautiful, quiet country! Maybe I can.</p>
