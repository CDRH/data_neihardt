Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>Sig writes how dear you are to him and I am not at all surprised but I <underline>am</underline> grateful.</p>
<p>This is a strange situation for all of us to be in adn I believe we are likely to sell and move up to St Louis sooner than you might suppose. Daddy is not getting into Jed Smith as readily as I hoped - and I believe it is due to his feeling the change about to happen. Sig being gone too makes us both feel even less at Home here and more</p>
65
<p>eager to be where we can be of real help to our children that <underline>need</underline> help, and closer to you and your Home. This place now is everything we once dreamed of making it, and remaining here from now on would mean that we just sat and looked at it all by ourselves - and that means we would grow old fast. <underline>Somebody</underline> will get a beautiful Home, and I do so hope we can sell to an aprreciative party.</p>
<p>There is an ad called Motor - In on Highway 50 2 miles East of Greys Summit that</p>
66
<p>sounds attractive to us. $1675 for big house and 3 cottages - but it woudl have to be seen before we could have any sort of plans regarding it.</p>
<p>I too hope we can seel for cash and then we can make a much better deal.</p>
<p>I am wearing the pink dress you gave me - adn how I do <underline>love</underline> it! It is the best fit I ever had.</p>
<p>Soon we'll be seeing you - and in the mean while Know that I love you more than I can say - </p>
Mama_Mother.
