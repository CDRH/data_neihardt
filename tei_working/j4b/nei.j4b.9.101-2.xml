Dearest girl,
I am so lonesome for you that I just had to drop you a few more lines! Bless your heart I love you & miss you to such an extent that I get no satisfaction out of trying to use letters to ex-press myself! I'm now getting dressed for another stunt tonite! 
So 'til 9 O'clock I'll wait for my date with you, dear girl! Endless Love, 
Sig.
