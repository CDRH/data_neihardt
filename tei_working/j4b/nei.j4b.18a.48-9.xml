142 Sigurd Neihardt Collection 48
[September, 1942]
Dearest Sigurd,
<p>You must feel how glad we here are for your fine outlook, maybe Daddy's foresight for you will still save you - I hope and pray that it may. I can't help feeling that Reynolds will offer you an immediate job in Cincinnati, and am much interested to hear <underline>which</underline> job you will then take.</p>
<p>Please note that I wrote Maxie about a strage dream I had before your letter came, it must have been the very night after you passed the physical exam. My dream was receiving <underline>2</underline> messages containing the</p>

<p>same or similar news. This only shows that in reality <underline>your</underline> fate is <underline>mine</underline> and in the <underline>real</underline> World there is no decision between us. This is true <underline>even though</underline> I <underline>never see you</underline> again. Life is more wonderful than we know, and Love binds together the Planets and our destinies. We should proceed without <underline>fear</underline> for in truth there is no separation and believe me, no matter what <underline>seems</underline> to be, the Neihardt Program will yet come to pass for Daddy, you, Hilda and Alice. God bless you my dear boy adn please let me hear from you a little oftener - for it means so much to your devoted</p>
old Mom.
