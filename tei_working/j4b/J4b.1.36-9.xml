We have been with you every hour since you left - and now tha tyou are in warm wea-ther we feel so happy that you are not here - for the snow is deep and it has been terrible winter with winds and very low temperature - all the time. We have been so peaceful though. and mother has been a real fairy-grandmother in all respect. I trust you got our little package
