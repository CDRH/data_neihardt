Sunday Morning
Precious Girl:
<p>Sig will give you this and tell you how I'm situated here in the Custer, whcih is one of a chain of hotels, the others being the Cornhusker in Lincoln and the Blackstone in Omaha - all first-rate.</p>
<p>I'm paying $2.25 a day with one day off for a weekly rate. With you here, the cost would be only $1 a day more - $6 for seven days. Board would be about $1 a day. So you see, you'd add only $2 a day to expense. My idea is for you to stay a little while with the girls, and come to me as soon as you like. I doubt if a kitchenette can be found - that is, one suitable for our position here. Sig will tell you. But I will ask a real estate firm</p>

<p>about it, and if a good one can be landed, I'll grab it at once.</p>
<p>The Custer is only 4 blocks from the College &amp; is in the heart of everything - fine stores, the best theater etc.</p>
<p>It will be good to stand still &amp; rest. Of course, the schedule at the College will be exhausting at times - bound to he; but good night rests will take care of that.</p>
<p>I'll take off-hand at convocation 9:30 A.M. tomorrow, &amp; the first regular lecture will be at 4:10 P.M.</p>
Endless love

<p>The Mother Superior at Mt. St. Joseph said:"You can't realize how long we live on this vist". They urge us to make that our home whenever we can stop on our travels. They said: "Don't announce your coming; just drive in &amp; say 'We're here'!"</p>
