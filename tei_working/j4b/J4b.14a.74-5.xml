Dear Enot and Ollie: 
We plan to leave here early on Thursday, Thanksgiving, and arrive at your place about 2:30 p.m. We will bring some bedding and canned stuff. I want the privilege of furnishing a goose for Thanksgiving dinner in the evening, and I wish Ol would buy it for me - a young one as large as possible - and let me pay for it when I arrive. This is definitely arranged, then, and you'll not thwart me. You'll need the goose early for long cooking; and for Christ's sake put a bellyful of whole (1007) wheat bread dressing in it! And don't forget plenty of onions! I have to stay the following Monday and Tuesday to get my dental job furnished, and we don't want to lengthen the visit too much
Incidentally, can't you have Dillard my dear old friend, tried and true - <del/> as a dinner guest, because

it will make me feel so good? And do you suppose Keller would come out too? Of course, you'd be sure to have Kirby, the lovely soul! 
Hope you succeed in locating ivory, so that I can grab a piece while there I'm into with longing to do that amethyst ring job. 
Endless love, 
Dad, 
Neihardt
