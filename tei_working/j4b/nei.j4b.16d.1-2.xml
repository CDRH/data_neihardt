Dearest Daddy and Mama!
<p>I failed to mention yesterday that you sent 90<cent/> too much for the dishes. As I recall it, they cost only $1.10, so you have 90<cent/> credit at this branch office.</p>
<p>We had a really gay time last evening at Enid's and Ollie's. The nine of us certainly raised a racket! Some meanies accused me of making more than my share, but of course that was not at all so!</p>
<p>Sigurd is looking so well and rested and happy now. I am very happy over the change. They (Maxie helps fine prospects) now have more prospects then Sig can call on, and I have no doubt that he'll soon be making quite a lot of money.</p>
<p>I do not see how I can sing in the Unitarian choir. I have too much else, adn Mr Serak says it is bad for one to sing with poor or ordinary singers. So i'll not do that. Right now going to bed early will do me far more good.</p>

<p>Mama, Alice is so happy you are making her a <underline>green</underline> costume. that color is particularly good for her. She said she would send you a zipper today.</p>
<p>Milly is such a dear. We all have so much fun with her. She fits in with us perfectly. She sends her best regards!</p>
<p>I hope to go to Al's lesson again tomorrow. I love to see her dance.</p>
<p>OPlease write!</p>
Loving you as ever,
Hilda
