Tuesday Evening. 
Dear Hiddy: 
Your letter is sensible. I supposed that perhaps Cralle knew of a situation existing among the students, and based my hope on supposition. I knew from my talk with the book store man that Springfrield doesn't read much, but I had no thought of the general public. Your plan for trying the scheme at Mrs. Henderson's is all right, especially isnce I feel that she will enjoy looking the books over & reading some of them. I really expect very little from the general public-hardly enough to justify the effort; but I"m for your trying. Here's another idea: could you sell to the lending libraries now in operation? Find out if <unclear/>. 
We'll be coming after you soon. This will reach you on Thursday. I don't promise that we'll be there Friday; but it is probable. The car is in fine shape. 
Endless love, old kid! 
Daddy
