Dear boy; 
I just got in: have been working in your yard-Had a boy moving and I clean up al the Edges, and everything looks beautiful-wish you could come in and see it.
Judge is here with Mrs. Twomley and Mrs. Pitman and he is a big packass and Mrs. Troomley is an other Mrs. Stoker-I wonder if the judge thinks we are all fools down here? He has not introduced <del/> "his women" to any one in the Hotel-By the way he has invited Mrs. Garner and me to go on The Lake Trip Tomorrow

in hoping I'll get sick or something.-He thinks he is giving me a treat when it will be a punishment to be with such snobs. 
I'll be so glad when they lean town, they are bothering in any old time and I work, and they should too. 
Boy you are planning to drive down the 8th arn't you? It will be a big disapointment if you don't.
