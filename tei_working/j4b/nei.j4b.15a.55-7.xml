Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>Your description of the marvelous Home you now live in makes me so very happy. I can see you helping Enid make is perfectly convenient Ollie dear, and I can feel Enid's intense satisfaction <underline>with</underline> her.</p>
<p>I am so grateful that you two have done just that - and know you will continue to fill your "nest" with everything that someday will add to the background of some little lucky Stranger all that will make him or her a very fortunate little person!</p>

<p>My heart still feels sore from Alice's departure - dear girlie - yet I was so glad and grateful that we <underline>could</underline> send her.</p>
<p>Also I feel heartsick over the War - Too bad if we should be drawn into this hideous thing - Sometimes I feel it simply can<underline>not</underline> be <underline>real</underline>.__</p>
<p>John and Sigurd are leaving in this month for a long trip. Things look pretty well - and Sig leaves no stone unturned. Daddy is so dear and good. The babies are sweet in such different ways. All of us are very busy - canning, washing, ironing, baking - you know it all dear children - I have no news but always the old story of my devotion and love for you both</p>
