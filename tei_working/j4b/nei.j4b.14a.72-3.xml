Dear Ollie: 
I'd be grateful if you would find out for me if any house in St. Louis can furnish pieces of ivory. Perhaps if you'd call up the Chamber of Commerce, they could tell you. Or maybe Jaccard's would give the information. I'd like a piece about 3/4" thick and 1" square; but, of course, could use a larger piece. I mention these dimensions as an indication of the minimum I could use. I want to get at Enots amethyst ring. 
An ivory billard ball would do the job. Maybe one could be procured, but I'd rather not pay for workmanship that would be destroyed. 
Affectionately always, 
Dad 
If you locate any ivory, I'd appreciate prices on pieces of various sizes 
I wish you'd tell Kenaware to see that my mail is forwarded to Branson. They're sending it to Enright and 
or opening my mail. This has been done a number of times. Kenamore will see to it. Give <unclear/>
