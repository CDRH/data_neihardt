Dear Mama:-
I want to see Grace awfully, and will go there if I can see my way at all. Bethlehem is in the extreme last of the state. I could get a train from Philadelphia, which is near, straight to St. Louis. Buffalo is pretty far north and out of the way a good deal. Maybe long will have something new to report at Bethlehem. I wish he'd have two $100 engagements up Grace's way!! Or just one! 
I'm glad you're all getting on well. It will be fine to look at you again 
Lots of love, 
Jno. 
I wrote news to Mona just now. I can't distribute letters equally, but I never write without thinking of all of you together 
<unclear/> thoughts for Mary.
