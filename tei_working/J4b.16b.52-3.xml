Dear Fatties
<p>It looks from here as though the firing of Hargy might mean a bit more safety for Sig - one fired being so much less overhead. Also, this would have fired Sig rather than Hargas hail that seemed in their interest. Just the same, it's hell for Hargas!</p>
<p>The cracker-box sounds interesting and who knows it hadn't a meaning? It's a queer world, as Jesus said when he was crossing the Delaware just before the battle of Waterloo!</p>
<p>I'm crating the stove &amp; will get it started North tomorrow I hope it enjoys its homecoming to K.C. I knew the <underline>letter</underline> would contain instructions for adjustmetn, so I opened it.</p>
<p>Sounds as tho you're getting warmer in the house-hunt. You'll probably find you're right about</p>
53
<p>the apartment. It's good to know you're in for just so much &amp; no more.</p>
<p>Have you yet chosen a suitable locality for both parties &amp; then prospected there in on foot? Might be the best way, as you'd have the locality settled at the outset and 1 person can do more &amp; better than any group I expect to have the coconut situation settled today, and, if so I'll have just enough nuts to keep the chimpanzees in a <unclear>frievoly</unclear> wood for 5 months, not counting any nuts from lectures.</p>
<p>There are two kewpie dolls here. Laine says I'm hers &amp; I say she's mine - so there you have two kewpie dolls.</p>
<p>I'll not forget when I go to the pasture.</p>
Endless love to all three
Dad
<p>Did I ever show you my crystal ring?</p>
