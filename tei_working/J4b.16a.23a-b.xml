Darling Girl:
<p>Just a word to go with Daddy's today. Your two letters are here darling and I understand you so perfectly in both of them. No indeed I am not peeved nor hurt - for you are right and I do sincerely appreciate your telling me the truth which I asked you for. You and Ollie <underline>have</underline> helped us a lot and besides you have made Alice happy. She says in every letter how fortunate she is to be with you and how dear you both are to her. I have written to Hilda, and am awaiting her answer before saying anything to Alice. Also I cannot plan till I hear from her. But we will make a change as soon as possible. In the mean while I do thank you for continuing to be so good to my baby - for that she will always be to me. Hilda speaks of coming home in May maybe for her vacation, and I would be so glad if Alice might remain with you until then. I feel that Hilda might want to make a change that would be better for her as well, and that would include Alice, and may be a better chance for her to practice on a Piano. I am just guessing - but anyway it will work out O.K.</p>
Loving you a whole lot
always your devoted
Mama.
