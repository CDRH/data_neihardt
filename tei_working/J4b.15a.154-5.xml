Precious Mona:
<p>I didn't receive a letter from you today, but no doubt you're all right. I wrote you yesterday about arriving in St. Louis.</p>
<p>At 4 P.M. I'll give my lecture on Lit Since 1912. Have been feeling much better, physically &amp; otherwise. Things have been going very well here, and my audience knows me now &amp; is with me. The same audience for each lecture, very faithful my bronchial trouble left last night - such a relief!</p>
<p>I'm <underline>not at all</underline> eager to see you &amp; the girls!!!</p>
Endless love
Jno Dad.
