<p>Dear Bower:</p>

	<p>Your dear Daddy wrote me a real letter, and in that letter he told me, among other things, that you have two beds and that you will give me my choice of the two when I come, or let me have both if I want them. Many

thanks, old pal! One will be enough, I believe; but I do appreciate your <hi rend-"underline">characteristic generosity</hi>. (I'll bet you can't read <hi rend-"underline">that</hi> one all by yourself. But I'll bet you Mama or Popa can explain.)</p>
	<p>I am enclosing pictures taken from the current issue of <hi rend-"underline">Pony Magazine</hi>.

I'm very fond of my Hackney filly, <hi rend-"underline">Creation's Queenie</hi>, and I love her very much. She is an aristocratic horse girl, and <hi rend-"underline">very beautiful</hi>. Her Popa and Mama and all her relatives are snooty blue-bloods, and just don't speak to common horses who are not registered!!

I am eager to have Queenie go to horse college and learn how to trot like a champion. She will start school in October. Next year, she will go to the big shows; and the year after <hi rend-"underline">I</hi> am going to drive her in the big 
<hi rend-"underline">Florida shows</hi>!</p>
	<p>How are you? How is school? Mine is fine.</p>
					
		<p>Affectionately, your Hon. Grandfather,</p>
