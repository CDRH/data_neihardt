Enid darling:
<p>Thanks for your interest. I am sending you the last letter from the Pottery, which please share with Hilda and then return to me. It seems that it is up to me to make a commerical apaption of the sea nymph or something similar, don't you think so too? Daddy does. I'll not go down to them till I have something I myself believe can be used commercially, that is, something without undercuts. I don't Know why I cannot do so and them maybe Mr Cornes will buy it. I believe it is worth trying anyway don't you and Ollie think so? I wish you'd tell me. Something will work out for us - so that we can feel far more prosperous than we now do. We are mightly lucky when we consider <underline>other</underline> people and their affairs. Yet personally I cannot be happy away from my girls. Sigurd adn Max are everything possible - and Daddy <underline>is</underline> getting along with Jed Smith</p>
9
<p>and has almost a month yet to work on it, before he and Sig go on their next tour.</p>
<p>I'm going to start quite a few Spring flowers here this year - I have not been home in the early Spring for several years.</p>
<p>You never told me what your Dr. said about your condition?</p>
<p>You shall have those baby things Enid dear - a little later when we are not so preoccupied with the cold.</p>
<p>That Social Security business is something Daddy has written to Jefferson City to find out about. We dont' mean old age Pension, which Daddy will get when 65 years old. Maybe it does not <sic>ammount</sic> to to anythign after all - We'll Know soon.</p>
Love to you all
from your devoted old
Mom - Mother.
