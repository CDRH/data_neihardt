Dear Dr. Neihardt: 
Whenever it is convenient, please send along the copy correcting several lines in "The Song of the Indian Wars". This way we will have copy in the office ready when we plan another reprint. 
I am anxiously looking forward to "The Old Man Remembers". 
Have you heard anything lately from Oregon and your biographer?

Cordially,
