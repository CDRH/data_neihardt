Dear Hiddy:
Here are seven slices of leberwurst. When you have time to rove around, see if you can run down an exclusive short-wave set, table model, that we know. If you don't locate one, tell Union-ward to look out for one at a bargain - used of course. 
And maybe while you're exploring you can find out where to get three nice brass knobs, (or other natural), ornamental bust dignified, to replace the knops now on our raddio. They must have a 1/4 such hole and should foster with a set of screw you know about how big the knobs shoudl be. They can be somewhat larger than those now on our radio. Everything fine. Getting good stuff, and will begin this week on The Death of Sitting Bull. 
Love always
Dad
