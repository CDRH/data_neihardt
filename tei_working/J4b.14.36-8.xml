Enright Ave., Saturday A.M. 
Very dear Ones:
I might as well write this one to all of you at once - including even the Cat and the frogs in the starlight! The letters arrived on time for a wonder-only one day to get here this time. Mighty glad for them. 
Doc did his worst and last yesterday evening, and now I have more teeth than Elaina has! Hiddy, Alice, Betty, and I had a modest little party afterward. The girls danced and Hiddy sang - like a cageful of nightingales. Golly! What a world it is by spells! There are arch-angels wings under that voice! 
I'm glad you're all bein' around as hard and happy (over)

as you can. 
Good news about Elaine's statue. We'll have fun putting it up, and a fine addition to the place it will be. 
Good about the wood, too - good that Llwellyn was honest. Order as much as you think we can use, Mona. It might as well be there. And I hope the coal turns out to be good. 
I'm delighted with my manager, Sig by far teh best I've had, I'm sure. Unless something happens to take my away, I verily be<unclear/> you'll make a killing for the next year. <del/> I don't somehow, feel solidly "put" yet, and dont know why! But "The music of what happens" will be good in any case. <del>(over)</del>

Old Joany on the merry-go-round! How wondeful it must have been to her! 
I do love you 
Jno. Dad 
The Bread arrived. A thousand thanks! 
I can't leave here before Wed. or Thursday. Doc has some fussing to do yet. He is going to cast the medallion & is immensely interested. It will be mailed to Branson later. He will also send some legend stone to be used in nothing mold of some other small thing that he will cast for us.
