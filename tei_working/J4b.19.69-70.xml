<hi rend="underline">Dearest Children</hi>:
<p>Your good letter, Enid makes me so glad and grateful, that you are You, and that you are mine!</p>
<p>You both Know that you can count on me to be with you Enid and to assist you Ollie in caring for our Girlie - But I still say that a good practical nurse is very necessary for the proper <hi rend="underline">delivery</hi> and a short time afterwards. A nurse who <hi rend="underline">Knows</hi> what is being done today and can do her part because of continued experience. Not that one must expect trouble, but Enid you <hi rend="underline">must have</hi> somebody besides your Dr, who can do more than Ollie or I can do. I trust and respect Ollie and feel sure he can do a lot of things I don't even suspect but please do make it your business to engage a nurse for you and the new baby right</p>

<p>soon. <hi rend="underline">If</hi> this is <hi rend="underline">impossible</hi>, then and only then am I in favor of your going to the hospital. In <hi rend="underline">any</hi> case I shall be with you and dear Grandma Fink is not at all necessary. Indeed I think as you do Enid, the fewer people the better. But I cannot take the place of one who Knows just the right things to do with the new baby, or who Knows just the right things to do for you - because while I have had babies myself, and miscarriages too, I have never assisted at another mother's giving birth to babies or a baby - so I would feel <hi rend="underline">guilty</hi> to assume I could take the proper care of this, the most dear baby in the world I may ever see - and its blessed mother. I'd feel <hi rend="underline">criminal</hi> and nothing less than that.</p>
<p>Did your Dr. say anything more definite than you already Know about when you can expect our baby?</p>
Please write again to
Your devotedly loving
Mama
