Dear Hiddy:
Here is some cash. Mama says this will do for this week. 
I've just made another engagement by wire - St. Cloud State Teachers College on Monday Jan 22. Moorhead is on Jan 18th! Will leave here Monday evening. 
(260 for the two) 
I was surprised to see the whole text of the funeral talk in last evening's paper. 
Endless love, Old Kid! 
Daddy 
After 5 days, return to
