Dear Mama and Daddy (if he is home now),
<p>it has now been several days since I last wrote you - in French. I am happy to hear from you soon. It seems so long since I received your letter - and I have received absolutely <hi>no</hi> other letters from the U.S. than your one. I understand you are busy, but I do not see why someone else does not write. If you would only drop a few lines <hi>often</hi>, I'd be <hi>so</hi> happy, Mama dear.</p>
<p>It has been lovely here - with rain storms almost every day, however - for an hour or more. Several days have been actually cold and not, but for the main the weather has been all one could ask. The sky is a <hi>light</hi>, never a tropical, blue, and frequently we are surrounded by a thin strata of fog, which hides the lovely mountains. It is all the more fascinating, therefore, to discover on a suhshiny morning that one <hi>can</hi> see these.</p>
<p>The other day I had a most fascinating experience. Having gotten dressed to go see the American Consul (whom it seems had been transformed since the Countess had been here, and finding her was not the same man ,men-</p>

<p>tioned on our letter of introduction we decided not to go - That left us all dressed up with "no place to go" - that day, at least herefore I decided on a "happing" expedition (The (")indicate <hi>ho</hi> intention to <hi>buy</hi> only to <hi>look</hi>) I took a bus to the Zoralo in downtown Mexico and there, last myself in the maze of little shops which border the lively, historical square of the old Cathedral and the Palace. I went up and down the little calles to search of "Jeyerirs"- jewelry shop, where I hoped to find some small gemstones afar Daddy. </p>
