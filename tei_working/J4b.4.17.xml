Dear Mama:-
Had a big authentic crowd at Fremont. They gave me $50 & will send the rest to Wayne. Don't know what I made, but probably as much as $50. The trip is paying surely, and I have a lot of good over ahead. Will be at Emerson <unclear/>. Should do well there, then Wayne will be big. Lyons Wakefield & Newcaste should do well. I've just half a notion to cut Cincinnati. It's a long trip & experience & $125 won't have me much still, I may go would go for $50 clear, & I guess I could save that much on the trip there & back Long in getting other engagements for way. things look very bright. 
Hope you are all well now Lots of love to you & all the rest - special lot for Grandma. 
John
