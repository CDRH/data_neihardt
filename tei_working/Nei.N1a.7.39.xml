DEAR DR. NEIHARDT,
I HAVE LIVED ONLY 38 YEARS, BUT I HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT IN EVERY MAN'S LIFE THERE ARE MOMENTS WHICH ARE JEWELS TO BE PUT IN HIS TREAURE CHEST OF MEMORIES. 
LAST SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE STHUR MUSEUM YOU GAVE MY WIFE AND I A WHOLE STRING OF PEARLS. 
TO HEAR YOU RECITE YOUR OWN WORK MADE SUCH A DIFFERENCE. I HAVE ALWAYS FELT WHEN I READ A POEM OR LYRIC MYSELF, IT WAS LIKE PLAYING A FLUTE SONG ON THE TUBA - AND YOU PROVED ME RIGHT! THE PITCH, INFLECTION ETC. OF YOUR OWN VOICE MADE IT RIGHT. 
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR A WONDERFUL MEMORY. 
SINCERELY,
BURTON R. NELSON DIR.
