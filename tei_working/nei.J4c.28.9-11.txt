Dear Lucile:

	<p>I woke this morning remembering a sentence in my letter of the 14th to you. It is the one in which I attach "tremendous significance" to my growing feeling about animals. Certainly the language seems (and may be) most intemperate, but I really had something important in mind. I've been reading Stewart Edward White's "The Unobstructed Universe", and it started me thinking again about

a deeper phase of consequences than we poor self-conscious human beings know, except in deep sleep or in moments of illumination. (You will remember the line in <hi rend="underline">Jed Smith</hi> about "what trees appear to know". This is concerned with the same idea I had in mind when I wrote that sentence. We do live largely in a shallow state of consciousness,

don't we? And can we doubt that the world-view growing out of that habitual state is much more than a "highly organized misunderstanding" (Poetic Values, you'll remember). Well, when I'm feeling very close to a horse or a dog, it is as though I experienced something of the deep, impersonal

and untroubled consciousness that is utterly free of self-seeking in any form and is all out-giving and loving. Anyway, I've wanted to apologize (in the strict sense of the word) for a sentence that could seem merely silly. I'm not sure that I read Sinclair's book on the Sacco-Vanzetti affair, altho'<sic>although</sic> I knew all about it at the time. I'm glad Upton is still "looking out the window"</p>
