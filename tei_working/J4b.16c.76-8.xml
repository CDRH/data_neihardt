THE ORDER OF BOOKFELLOWS
Monday A.M. 
Dear Ollie &amp; Enot:
<p>It was good to hear from you, as always. Sorry the Kearney letter didn't catch us, but we rec'd it here.</p>
<p>It was a glorious trip, physically and otherwise stimulating. We ran into a big nest of fans at Denver, and a nice group at Boulder. The responses all along were bully. I'm at work again. The note is reduced to $750 (from $900) taxes paid, amd $325 in bank to go on for awhile.</p>
<p>I was so glad Mama could have a thoroughly happy time on the trip, meet many fine &amp; sympathetic people - <underline>and</underline> wear <underline>all</underline> her clothes. She <underline>was</underline> happy, &amp; it did her worlds of good. We're the best of fellows travellers &amp; have <underline>such</underline> a lovely time together.</p>
<p>So you have becoming g - d - plutocrats with a country home! Hurrah!</p>

<p>No doubt you'll be very glad you started buying when inflation begins to be more &amp; more noticeable. And it's great to have that glorious feelin' of owning the patch of earth you haunt.</p>
<p>I'm remembering that <underline>Baby</underline> in the pasture! Hasten his or her arrival! We love it already, Nanny and I.</p>
Endless love to both and each:
Dad.
<p>The Knife is growing! Dr. Katt sends affectionate meows. He showed up only once while we were gone. Nevertheless, he <underline>appeared</underline> wihtin 20 minutes after we arrived! How did he know? Mrs. Cantivell feared he was gone for good. But he must have watched for the car to appear. He was in perfect conditon.</p>
