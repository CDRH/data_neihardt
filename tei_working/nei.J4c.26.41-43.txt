Dear Lucile:

	<p>This is not a letter, and you must not hold it against me that I seem to be writing out of turn! This is only a note. I want to tell you something before I forget. (You and I must be awfully careful about such things). Well - about stories &amp; poems from 1901 to 1914 not collected in books:
Around 1906-07 the Outing Magazine published stories of mine with illustrations by Schoonover, <unclear>, etc. Have you looked those up? I recall <hi rend="underline">The Epic Minded Seat</hi>, <hi rend="underline">The Dead Man's Dog</hi>, <hi rend="underline">The Brutal Fact</hi>, the latter  being a first telling of the <unclear> shooting

incident. You will want to look up the Outing stories. Caspar Whitney was editor then - <hi rend="underline">a great editor</hi> of his day. He sent me down the Missouri River to write eight articles on the trip. (This is 
<hi rend="underline">The River and I</hi>. Then do you know <hi rend="underline">To a Hat Pin</hi>, published in Truth 
(<hi rend="underline">a high-class magazine</hi>) along about 1902? (Lucile, this one is a lark!! It was all about the girl with the long golden hair who lived across the street - Edith Perdel! We used to go on skating parties. Bitter cold nights.

big fires! And <hi rend="underline">have</hi> you seen <hi rend="underline">The Tiger's Lust</hi>, a long short story published in the old Philadelphia Ledger about 1902-03? If you haven't seen <hi rend="underline">that</hi> one, Lucile, you aint seen nuttin' yet." (It bought my mother's false teeth - her first.)</p>
	<p>There was an obscure but hopeful little magazine along about 1903-04-05 that published a sketch of mine, called <hi rend="underline">The Hot Wind</hi>, a memory of my experience in Kansas when I was

five and six. I can't remember the name of the magazine, or even where it was published. And do you know 
<hi rend="underline">The Wind God's Wooing</hi>? This was printed in colors on our Bancroft Blad press. Spenserian stanzas, I remember - wow!!</p>
	<p>I enclose the letter from old Rex's newphew! The high prairie wind, the dust, the shattering rain and the coffin being lowered!! O Lucile, dear friend, in the short view it's a most pathetic business, isn't it? Rex was delighted over his correspondence with you.</p>
