Dear Mama:
<p>Your letters, also those from Dad, have been lots of satisfaction to us here.</p>
<p>We are so glad that things are now under control better for you &amp; Dad.</p>
<p>It is a shame that I've been unable to anymore than barely keep my family going, up here, financially. This is the only reason why I've not sent any money to you folks. Right now, in spite of having proceeded more carefully than ever, we have to count pennies to get by. Amama can tell you that our apartment is not even fully equipped. We have no piano because we needed this money for doctor bills for the kids &amp; myself. We also do not even have a table &amp; chair outfit to dine with.</p>
<p>All the above damned situation most certainly will change in a few weeks, because of the promotion which is pending. Living costs more in N.Y., but after getting up into the standard bracket of incomes a fellow is then O.K.. By this, I mean that in N.Y. salaries <hi rend="underline">are</hi> higher after one</p>
over
-2-
<p>gets a promotion of the kind I'm expecting.</p>
<p>Dr. Katz says yes he knew lots of 'Katz' people around Gernsbach. Neither Maxine nor I think this doctor is Jewish. He looks <hi rend="underline">very</hi> German.</p>
<p>I wish, Mama, that you could know - also that Dad could know - the things I <hi rend="underline">'gather'</hi> about the war. Have you observed the distinct shortage of news from the Russian front? Of course you have! It's all Tunisia stuffy, &amp; very much too optimistic. I am very much moved by the recent Jap operations. I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> look for some serious <hi rend="underline">'defensive'</hi> fighting on our part in the near future.</p>
<p>Please take care of yourself &amp; write soon again.</p>
Always all our love,
Sig &amp; family.
