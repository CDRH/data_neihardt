Dear Bower:

	It was dear of you - and characteristic - to work for me out there, as you have done. I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> appreciate your goodness, and if they invite me, I'll accept it with pleasure. If they <hi rend="underline">don't</hi> invite me - and they well may not - I'll plan to zizz out there anyway. I do want to take a look at you dear people in your new and beautiful home. So I'll zuzz (golly, what a fine word, invented by your precious lady!) out, look at each of you with a warm, devouring gaze,

-2-

exchange a few happy words with you all, and zizz right back here to wish I'd stayed longer, <hi rend="underline">much, much</hi> longer!
	With or without an invitation, I think Spring would be the best time. Still, I do get a lost feeling now and then - and I might decide to zizz while it's still deep winter. Anyway, it's going to be quite all right<sic>alright<sic> one way or the other, and bless your heart for being so good to this old man!

					Affectionately,
