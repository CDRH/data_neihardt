<p>Dear Dr. Kendrick:</p>

	<p>Of course I'll come - Thursday, May 17. But I think I should arrive in Ithaca on Wed., May 16 at 1 p.m. I don't want to be rushed, and maybe a bit tired. I've spoken to our chairman, Dr. Peden, and he says "John, take your time and be happy. We'll take care of your classes." In <hi rend="underline">Epic America</hi> we'll be in <hi rend="underline">The Song of the Indian Wars</hi>, and there are two doctors on the faculty who know &amp; love the stuff - <hi rend="underline">and</hi> are eager to carry on for me. My students in creative writing are friends, and they will carry on without me. If I'm there a bit longer, perhaps I could meet with an 

-2-

English class. This is only a notion, but I'd be willing.</p>

                               <p>Affectionate thoughts,</p>
                             <signature>John Neihardt</signature>
