                    <salute>My dear Mr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I presume you are surfeited with letters of appreciation from people who like your poetry, but having just read all three narratives of the epic cycle I cannot forbear the pleasure of telling you how much I admire both the poems and the quiet devotion you have shown to a great task.</p>
                
                <p>I have no doubt of the permanent place this cycle will claim in E<del/><add>n</add>glish literature. Even in its present incomplete form it is, I believe, the best body of narrative poetry written by any American Poet, and I see no reason why it should not loom into Chaucerian proportions.</p>
                
                <p>Reading the three poems together, I could not fail to notice the freer movement of the verse in the "Song of the Indian Wars" when compared with the "Song of Hugh Glass." The latter, of course, is exalted by the simplicity and strength of the drama it contains, but when I read the "Song of the Indian Wars" I felt that you had been criticising the "Song of Hugh Glass" in much the same way that Keats criticised "Hyperion." I never could see anything wrong with Hyperion, nor did I with the "Song of Hugh Glass," save that the limpid quality of the later poem seemed to reveal a slight straining which the desire for richness of expression had placed in the earlier.</p> 
                
                <p>Perhaps the above is not clear, and it may not mean much even if it is clear. Anyway, the "Song of the Indian Wars" has richness of expression along with a wonderfully easy narrative flow, and the difficulty of the subject matter makes it a doubly fine achievement.</p> 
                
                <p>A few years ago, when I was editor of the St. Louis Star, my wife and daughter and I floated down the White River and we almost stopped at your homme. Your escape was due mainly to the fact that we had not read any of your longer poems and didn't dare admit it. I wanted then to ask you what you thought of the Ozarks as a place in which to hibernate while eliminating the "a" from literary avocation. California is all right except that it has no chiggers and thus reduced the itch to wr<del><unclear>g</unclear></del><add>i</add>te.</p>
                
                    <pb facs="nei.j4a.12.30-31_0002"/>
                    <fw type="curatorial">31</fw>
                    
                <p>When so much attention is paid to self-advertisers, mutual admiration cliques and neurotics, when nothing <del/><add>i</add>s sublime except audacity, the place your poetry has won in a few years is extremely heartening. I do not know to what extent it is going into the public schools, but it is destined to enter all of them, and I think there is more satisfaction in that than in many other forms of acclaim.</p>
