Enid Darling:
<p>Daddy just now told me that I might go up with you if you come this weekend - so that I can be present at Alice's graduation. I am so deeply, gloriously happy and grateful so Daddy for this privilege that I feel my cup is indeed full and running over. So please come Friday if you can, and until then a million thanks to Ollie and to you.</p>
Always your devoted and admiring
Mama-
Mother.
