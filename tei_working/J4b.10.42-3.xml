Dear Hiddy: 
Here are some more pretzels. Those were bully letters. I'm really glad about the way you write. You can easily make a corking journalist, if you - go in for it. You have a feeling for a congrage, and you say waht you want to say with a style that is yours. 
I'm building a dog house, a dandy. 
Am looking forward to your coming down with Elanita 
Love always
Dad
