Dearest Mama, 
It is Sunday & we're both being good - writing letters to ours at home. I will remember very likely to get Joanie a little boat to play with, before we get away from the cities we have to go through. Your letters surely mean lots to Dad, & if is fine to receive them wherever he goes. 
We certainly had a nice time at Peru! The doings here has been sensibly planned & we should give them a treat. 
I have been warding off the botherations of people trying to engage Dad for extra (free) performance.

He has not been personally contacted as I've done this part so that he can rest up. Rather nice little town here. Very clean etc. Nothing to write excepting that I hope you are well and happy, also that I love you forever & ever. 
Always - 
Sig.
