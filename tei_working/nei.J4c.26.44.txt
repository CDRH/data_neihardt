Dear Bower:

	As you know, I wrote Lucile that I'd like to visit at your home from about Dec. 26 to around Jan. 1. That is the only free time I can see ahead before next summer, and we have a lot to do, I feel, before Lucile begins writing on the biography. She says for me to come on, that Gramby will be there, but you will be in

Washington! I wonder, is Fate trying to be funny? Last time you were in the hospital. This time, 
<hi rend="underline">if</hi> I come, are you to be on the other side of the continent?
	This is the point of my note: Do you plan to be away <hi rend="underline">all that time</hi>? Would I miss you entirely?

				     Affectionately
                                 <signature>John</signature>
