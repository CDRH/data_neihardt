	<p>Dear Slade:</p>

	<p>Another dear letter from you - and I do love them! Everything goes on here in keeping with an overall pattern, I believe. My classes are a source of much satisfaction to me, and, I hope, to some of my students. I have at least <hi rend="underline">two</hi> really good writers in my Critical Essay class, and even the least gifted in writing show a creative interest in ideas chosen in the hope of expanding the everyday awareness of things. My Epic America students <hi rend="underline">do</hi> seem interested. I always wonder about this.</p>
	<p>Our colts are growing joyously. My God! how they <hi rend="underline">do love to live! Galloping, kicking, pooping, snorting - with tails like banners waving in a wind of glory!</hi></p>

	Mrs. Aly (now at the University of Oregon) is pushing ahead with her research, completing her dissertation (doctorate) on my work from the viewpoint of speech, <hi rend="underline">and</hi> preparing for the biography she will write later. I'm fortunate to have found her for she is devoted, thorough, and gifted. I have the task of writing to her about many things bearing on my life and my writing, as questions come to her in her research.</p>
	<p>The family is well. Yo-yo (the <hi rend="caps">DOG</hi> is growing wiser and sweeter, and I wonder how a little skin can enclose so much love. (Of course it <hi rend="underline">doesn't enclose at all.)</hi></p>
	<p>I think so often of you and your Lady. You are dear, dear.</p>

							<p>Affectionately,</p>
