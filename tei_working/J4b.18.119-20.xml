Dear Daddy and Mama:
<p>I am returning your letter from General Electric, Mama. We are all quite thrilled and hope something will owrk out for you in this connection.</p>
<p>Daddy, I am returning your letter from Nebraska. It's a very nice letter - and I'm really glad there is no chance there; for I believe you'd not care so much for that place.</p>
<p>We had a nice day yesterday. Albert and I got up fairly early and took a nice walk. Afterward Albert worked on our book, which is now practically finished. The hinges are <underline>very</underline> attractice after being hammered. The window is now in; half of a doublesided pocket mirror made a perfect glass.</p>
<p>We say Eny yesterday and Nei, and</p>

<p>we worked in our garden. We have soem nice bean plants-.</p>
<p>We've had only a card from Alice since she left. I hope to have a letter today. Have you heard more?</p>
<p>We are having Albert's parents over for dinner Wednesday. They both have birthdays about that time, so we are making it a birthday party.</p>
<p>Right now there is no news. We are all well.</p>
<p>You should see Nei in the jumper! He really likes it!</p>
<p>Write soon!</p>
Endless love as even to you and to Amama,
Hilda
<p>Later: The "Treasure Shop" no longer wants the ring. They said the $125 after <unclear/> Jaccard's was a very good one! I don't know what we'll do, it seems a shame to sacrifice the ring.</p>
