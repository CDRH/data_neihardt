<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>This is Saturday, 9:30 a.m. - 7:30 a. m. in Eugene. Within the next few hours you three should be taking over the beautiful new home; and as I think of it, I too feel happy and excited along with you.
		Later, p. m.

	<p>You <hi rend-"underline">were</hi> lucky in your book-hunting! <hi rend-"underline">Man-Song</hi> and <hi rend-"underline">Wayfaring</hi> are both a bit scarce. I hope your dealer was not aware of the scarcity. You say you are reading <hi rend-"underline">Man-Song</hi> again. Last night I dreamed I was reading it, and I came across a corking passage I had not known in a

-2-

poem I had never heard of - but it was mine. For a moment after waking I almost knew the passage, but it evaporated. I can tell you <hi rend-"underline">it was good poetry. It felt great!</hi> I wish I could find it again. (Incidentally, there must be some really good poetry down in there someplace, waiting to be found.)</p>
	<p>Sandy Gray is here. He has re-entered the graduate school, and he says he has 30 hrs, on a Ph.D <hi rend-"underline">But</hi>, he is married and everything, and there is a baby on the way. They are living in a trailer which she owns.

She has a teaching job at Hickman High. (Sandy has grown obese.) We are supposed to move ahead with recording. I hope it may be so.</p>
	<p>So you were in Moscow! I wonder if my old friend, Harrison Clifford Dale (sometime president of the University &amp; author of the <hi rend-"underline">Ashley-Smith Explorations</hi>, is still living. I wish I could have rejoined you for that Idaho trip. We begin school here a week from today, Sep. 15. (You see this is a serial letter, and already it's Tuesday). I was in my office several days ago and met young Dr. Jones

who follows Moffett and will be next to my desk. He is a lovable fellow, &amp; he was clearly happy to see me. Evidently someone had said something nice about me to him. We'll click, I know. But, Lucile, something good and dear has ended forever. For 10 1/2 years Moffett and I sat there side by side, speaking <hi rend-"underline">when</hi> and <hi rend-"underline">as we pleased</hi> about this, that, or anything. <hi rend-"underline">We knew each other, &amp; there were no fences. That's through. Blessed years</hi>! But why should anything last forever? Why should

-5-

I be as fortunate as I've been and am? As I look back, I note so many <hi rend-"underline">great changes</hi> in my life. Each one seemed saddening; and yet I would not return to the far side of any of those changes for anything. 
<hi rend-"underline">The pattern is good</hi>. You'ns are 2000 miles away, but that makes you dearer, requiring more effort to see you. (I can "zuzz" out to see you! Can't I?)</p>
	<p>My friend, Dr. Slade Kendrick of Cornell University spent Sat. afternoon with me. He is a dear. His specialty is Finance with emphasis on taxation. He will testify before a 

-6-

Congressional committee again this month. Your dissertation was mentioned and he said, "I want that lady's address. She is going to get a letter from me, for I have something to tell her." So I suppose you'll hear. I hope he uses a typewriter. His handwriting is a bit trying! (How's mine?!) I don't know the poet Stafford, and he isn't in <hi rend-"underline">Who's Who</hi>; but if he likes my stuff, he is a gentleman and a scholar. Just the same, <hi rend-"underline">nice lady</hi>, I'm glad you beat him to those books!</p>
	<p>Yes, someday we will watch a horse-show together. Maybe my Creation's Queenie will be showing. If so, maybe you will help me yell when she comes by <hi rend-"underline">floating high</hi> in that marvelous trot of hers! (She is a fine-harness pony, you know). Or maybe the two (or three or four ) of us will stand at the turn of the track as the five-gaited horses charge by -  big, beautiful, sleek

-8-

creatures! And as they turn, we'll feel their fragrant, explosive breaths on our faces! It's a wonderful feeling! They are so gorgeously alive, so haughtily beautiful!</p>
	<p>It's queer, Lucile. Old, half-forgotten pieces of patterns have been coming back the last two or three years - completing circles. A number of old acquaintances or friends have suddenly remembered me after many, many years, and written me. Recently there was Blanche Shoemaker Wagstaff, and now here comes William Stanley Braithewaite,

-9-

of all people! He begins by explaining who he is (!!) Says he was one of the first to praise Hugh Glass &amp; refers to his review in "the old Boston Transcript." (As tho'<sic>though</sic> I <hi rend-"underline">could</hi> forget that wonderful article!!) He wants me to contribute a poem to an anthology on the Civil War! Of course, I cannot.</p>
	<p>Do you ever have time to go back over our trip in imagination? I do that, and it's a joy. I may have had an "experience" last

-10-

Sunday. Hilda &amp; Gail were here an hour or so, and they did some woman-magic about the place. I was in the basement under the dirty clothes chute, &amp; they were directly above in the region of the bathroom and adjacent bedrooms. There was a mess of dirty clothes on the concrete floor instead of being in the basket. I reached down to gather them up, and there came a sound as of knuckles tapping a solid wooden surface - 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, 6. Then, after a brief interval the sounds were repeated.

-11-

The sounds seemed <hi rend-"underline">close</hi> to <hi rend-"underline">me</hi> &amp; were quite distinct. I rushed upstairs &amp; asked if Hilda or Gail had heard the sounds. They had not, and they said they had done nothing to make the sounds. Since I am the only witness, I don't make too much of the matter, <hi rend-"underline">but, according to me</hi> it was very clear &amp; I can't explain it.

-12-

It has been very hard to get this letter written, because I don't like you at all, and I don't like any of the Alys.* (<hi rend-"underline">Or do I?)</hi> That trip we had together was a perfectly horrible experience, and I hope it may happen again as soon as possible.</p>
				<p>Love to each of you Three.</p>

* <p>I do <hi rend-"underline">too</hi> like you! The very idea!! <hi rend-"underline">Who</hi> said I didn't?!</p>
