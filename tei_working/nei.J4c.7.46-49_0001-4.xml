Dear Sterling:-

Anything sourish is best for my liver; but in the Volstadisn age most anything goes.

I didn't make my meaning clear in the matter of "small town" fiction. What I object to is the assumption that there is a distinct small town mind. I say that is a fiction. What is mistaken for the small town mind may be found anywhere. There was once a rural type of mind, but it's been shot all to hell by newspapers, magazines, movies, <unclear></unclear>, telephones, rural routes etc.

I wish to God I could review in the sea with you. I want to learn some fractured things from you, and I know you could teach me. Do you find fresh-water swimming much more difficult than salt-water swimming? Also, I'd probably have a hell of a good time in salt water, for fresh water is all I know, and it seems pretty easy.

How did you manage to write a poem of that length without getting at least one "goose in the boot"? Mighty good poetry too. What poweys said of "Lilith" doesn't strike me as funny at all. I believe he's right. Your stuff stands a mighty good show of surviving for two reasons, excellent reasons.

I've been reading too much along with my other work, + day before yesterday I went to pieces. Thought it was "flu", but it was stomach, bowels, nerves, eye-strain. I read 12 books in 7 days besides writing reviews + working on "The Indian Wars". Am a bit wobbly yet today, but I'm coming around + getting my tail up again.

Always yours,

John

Don't gather from what I said that  ithink I'm some swimmer. I'm just a fair dub, doing what I do easily; but dozens of youngsters here are better than I am. I can do less with the breast stroke than with any other, except the crawl which i don't know well. The over-arm side stroke seems to me the fastest, most powerful. The <unclear></unclear> is nice for a change, but it tires me sooner than the side overarm.
