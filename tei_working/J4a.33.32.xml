Dear John,
<p>I'm as glad you're liking the book. I think you'll like the revision in the <underline>Being and Saying</underline> section; it's more concise and generally better. I appreciate your writing me; the eyes must be getting stronger.</p>
<p>I have my plane tickets, and I will see you <underline>a week from Saturday</underline>!! We will talk about all your comments, and I'll bring you the last chapter. It will be almost final copy - but if you have letters there that I ought to quote I'd like to get in some very recent material from your admirers who write. If you can lay out some for me I'll get them Xeroxed while I'm in Lincoln. Mrs. Young has been wonderful about sending clippings.</p>
<p>No, I haven't done anything about a publisher. I feel obligated to the Nebraska Press if they want the book, and I hope I can see Mr. <unclear>Nicholl</unclear> while I'm there. I also think they should republish <underline>Indian Tales</underline> and <underline>When the Tree Flowered</underline> - Indian stuff is big time right now, and yours is unique, I've been reading Jung, as you'll see.</p>
<p>Dear John, I'm really excited about seeing you. It has been a long time, and thinking about you so much as I wrote made me miss you even more. Do you think it could possibly be that I <underline>like</underline> you? We'll have three great days!</p>
Love,
Lucile
P.S. Jungle sends her lickiest love. She is only sorry she can't come too.
