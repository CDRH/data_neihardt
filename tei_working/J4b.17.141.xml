Darling Girlie
<p>I'm still waiting for that long zipper; your costume is all done including pants. <underline>Do</underline> let me have what I need. Can not get long enough zippers here. I am heartsick at receiving nothing from you, at all. Did you receive the bread? I do want to help. Also I want to be present at your recital worse than anything. Don't tell me you are very busy, I Know that. Sig came last night, and we are so happy to see him, but he has been terribly blue and worried. Hope Daddy can make him feel better.</p>
<p>A slendid letter from MacMillan's came today. They are delighted with Jed Smith. We are not going West till Fall.</p>
Loads of love for my own wonderful girlied from her devotedly loving 
Mama.
