Dear Max,
Loafin' aroun' here in Moberly now - to kill time! 
Went thru mark Twain's home & cave etc, also saw his monument overlooking the Mississippi River! 
The car is running beautifully, & very comfortable too! In spite of teh engine being more powerful, it gives more gas & oil mileage!

Hannibal is surely an old place, and how! Was interesting to see S.L. Clemen's name in the cave high up in the top of a pass! I don't know of anything to write so I'll stop! I have missed you something terrible! Saw a few good shows different places, & did wish for you! 
I played really well at Lindenwood for a change! 
(over) 

I'm just now starting to feel like myself! Getting ready to go to Sedalia & kill more time! Next program is at Warrensburg Wed. Nite! Then - home we go! With all kindest tho'ts 
Love to you, 
your S.N.
