Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>Because of a revision in federal accounting procedures, our program in the Southwest was delayed, and for this reason I have waited to write to you and other members of the advisory committee. You recall that I had consulted you on how to establish a program for Spanish-American and Indian children similar to programs we have sponsored in New York and other cities. These programs have introduced poetry readings and discussions of poetry into the classrooms.</p>
<p>We are now on the verge of reviving our plans and I shall hope to send a specific outline for your recommendations. I shall also hope to be in the Southwest during the first week in March and at that time perhaps can ask you directly for suggestions.</p>
With many good wishes,
Sincerely yours,

'X' if you will be there!
