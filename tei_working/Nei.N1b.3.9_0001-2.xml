Precious Hiddy: 
I don't know what has been written to you about B. E. "in full regalia"! but you know as I do,
that he didn't wear a sun-bonnet with gorgeous feathers. In the picture of him on the mountain he
was dressed - as a holyman should dress. That picture is to be found in my Western M S Collection, I
think. Also, I believe it is in the Morrow first edition of Black Elk Speaks. This will be
found in the end index of my library collection's or maybe in the reading room of (over) 

-2-
my - collection - "Books by and about Neihardt" These <unclear>latter</unclear> <del/> ones may have been put in a
separate case. 

It has just struck me that there <del/> is a copy of the Morrow edition of B E. Speaks at
Skyrim or you may have one. In that edition I believe there is this picture of B. E. on the mountain.

There is, of course, the <del>fine</del> fine photograph of B.E. and me as to Victory Dance.
But B. E. does not <del/> look like an Indian in the picture,-but, rather, like a <unclear>Mongolian</unclear>.
I love you,
