Dearest Ones:
We're headed south and will arrive Friday. I'm hurrying checks to you herewith. We are well. Marvelous time at Wayne. Spent a night at allen. Burke's home in Bancroft - Old - Timer's came in to see us. Lovely evening. We want to stop in K.C. on way down - not long, This is written in the car at Omaha. 
Endless love from both of us to the dearest ladies and to the ba-a-a-d girls!
