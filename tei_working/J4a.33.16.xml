Mr. John G. Neihardt

Lincoln, Nebraska 68505

Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>We have checked your papers, but do not find the petition signed by members of the Order of Indians Wars which paved the way for you to become an honorary member of the organization. We did find the certificate, dated Januardy 30, 1925, naming you an honorary member. H. R. Lemly had written you the day before saying it was in preparation.</p>
<p>The earliest letters form Mr. Lemly in the collection is dated February 20, 1920.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Nancy Prewitt</signed>
(Mrs.) Nancy C. Prewitt
