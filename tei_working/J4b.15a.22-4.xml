<p>Hilda, my own Darling - Words cannot give any adequate expression to my disappointment. When the car for which we had waited eagerly since 1 o'clock finally arrived around 6 with only the two men in it, Well _ Joanie voiced our feelings by crying unresevedly - <underline>what</underline> a greeting for her Gaki and Daddy! I felt as though I had been struck over the head - and then wanted only to fade away into nothingness - <underline>any</underline> thing rather than remain alive and conscious of that <underline>void</underline></p>
<p>I suppose your Mutti is an exagerated creature - but Oh - she does love you so - and your failure to arrive</p>
24
<p>yesterday was one of the bitterest disappointments I ever had.</p>
<p>I have no letter from you for so long - and Daddy simply does not Know how to carry news that would give me relief - he says everything with you is fine etc - but some how it does not carry conviction to my foolish old heart. So Hilda, <underline>please</underline> tell me something <underline>definite</underline> about your plans. Just so you <underline>do</underline> what you tell me. I hope Mr Pesch is worth all this - but I sincerely doubt it. No man is worth it. Please tell him from your Mother, that he <underline>has</underline> to give you your hard earned 3 weeks vacation or <underline>else</underline>!! Such powerless words! I realize that too - but I simply cannot stop my heart <underline>gnawing</underline> at me.</p>
<p>Max and I have been working so much to have things nice for your arrival. Please write when you will come to your <sic>ownly</sic> Mutti.</p>
