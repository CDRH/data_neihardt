Darling Hilda:
<p>Thank you so much for your dear thoughtfulness - The valentines too. I wonder if the time has ever to come when I am no more your valentine? I hope not!-</p>
<p>I want so much to see you and Albert and Know definitely how to plan for your wedding. I do so want it to make everyone happy, most of all <underline>you</underline>.</p>
<p>If we are to Keep this home I want to have a monument to John in cement on the grounds. I have a fine idea for one which I'd love</p>
31
<p>to tell you about!</p>
<p>This is the first day I really feel more well than sick. My head does not ache at all, but I am so weak. The slightest exhertion makes me want to lie down. Daddy has been so good, doing every necessary thing for all of us. The Wubs are well and so good! I believe this week end will be warmer than last one would have been, but be sure to bring plenty of bed covers.</p>
Always devotedly loving you
Mutti
