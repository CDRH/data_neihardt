<p>Dear Bower:</p>

	 <p>Many thanks for your letter! Of course I'll be glad to do whatever you want me to do, and you may feel free to use me as you wish. I had planned to fly back on Thurs., but I think there is still time to change the return date. I'll try at once, and let you know whether I can return on Saturday. I've arranged to fly by United Air Lines<sic>Airlines</sic> leaving

Kansas City at 2:20 p. m. on  Feb. 20, and arrving in Portland at 8:05 p. m., your time. This will be <hi rend="underline">flight 547</hi>. I'm so eager to be with you (both singular and dual number!) and I'll be glad to be with some of your students and friends.</p>

					    <p>Affectionate thoughts,</p>
