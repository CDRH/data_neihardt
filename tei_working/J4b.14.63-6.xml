We tried to ge the Sunday edition of the great liberal newshoper with your article in it, Ollie; but there wasn't a copy in town. Please send the article, andw e'll return it. I want to see the later article too.

I've just rec'd another letter from Bovard, in which he says:

We are ready for a siege. Have coal for all winter, also 10 richs of wood and 550 cans of vegetables and fruit. I'll raise the Cotter to 600 with some more canned apples. We need only a case of 22 shells to hold off an army!! I'm thinking of sending Hitler an ultimation in the "gravest" sort of diplomatic language! But I must first lay in a good supply of 22's.) 
Love jointly and singly!
