Dearest Joan: 
When you receive the diamond ring I'm sending you'll be engaged to your Grandpa until you are able to do better. And maybe by that time Grandpa can do better in the way of a diamond. 
But, by gosh, this is an honest - to goodness diamond, all cut just like a huge one! 
You must wear it on your biggest finger when you go out to dine and dance. And when that finger gets too big, then wear it on the next biggest, and so on, until the littlest finger is too big. Then tell Grandpa, and we'll have the ring enlarged. 
Joany got a diamond ring! Dog-gone! 
With love always, 
Grandpa Neihardt
