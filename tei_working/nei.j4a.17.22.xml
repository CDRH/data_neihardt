                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>A good many years ago, four to be exact, you were very kind to me. I had then published my first book---I was nineteen, and the book was called <hi rend="caps">TWO VALLEYS</hi>. Among all the people who reviewed it, you were the only one who said a few kind words, without reference to my age.</p>
                
                <p>I should have thanked you then, but I was too discouraged to write anything else for a long time. Nobody who reviewed the book said that I had put anything into it, or that I had any business writing at all. They tore down all my hopes, and for four years afterwards, I wrote nothing that mattered a great deal. I did read your review a few times, I had to read it, whenever I tried to write anything else, but it's hard to believe nice things said by only one person. Still, I hold onto it: and if you read it ever now, perhaps you will understand what you did for me. The review was in Post Dispatch of September 17, 1933.</p>
                
                <p>After four years of a good many things---not so much writing---I made another book, which Harcourt Brace will publish <del><unclear>July</unclear></del><add>August</add> fifth. It's called <hi rend="caps">PLACE IN THE CITY</hi>. Please don't think I am writing this beacause I want you to review the book. I don't care; but I do want you to read it. I want you to read it because of the review you wrote in 1933, when I was nineteen, and I think you will read it if you look at that review again.</p>
                
                <p>I can't thank you enough for what you did then. But my work after this will be a sort of thanks. Would it be asking too much for you to write me a few words about the book? I hope not and I hope you will write.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Sincerely yours,</salute>
