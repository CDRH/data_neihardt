Dear Miss DeLowry: 
I am interested in your project - a somatic study of Neihardt's work - and I note that you would be
principally interested in the short stories. I think you and I should have a meeting, and I think
you should consult Dr. Lucile Aly's bibliography, which lists practically everything that  I have
written. I have a copy here but am not free to loan it. 
I have written Mrs. Prewitt of the Western Manuscripts Col-lection, and a copy of that letter is
enclosed. 
If you can come to Lincoln to talk with me, it would be well to call us for an appointment. 
Yours,
John Neihardt
