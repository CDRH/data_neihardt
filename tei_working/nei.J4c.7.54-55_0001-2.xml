Dear Sterling:-

Just a word. Am rushing to get away from here Oct 24, and have a sore thumb! Will be in your country. Sometime mean Nov. 15th. We'll have a pow-wow!

Your lyric, "The Dead Captain" strikes me as being one of your very best. It's intensely human and bites in every line. I love it. My wife, too, likes it very much. It perfectly fits the case of her own family. While her father lived, money grew on trees. When he did, the miracle ceased. He was a real fellow, too loving to maintain his high place in modern finance. He was American representative of the Dutch house of <unclear></unclear> + Company + was for years president of the MK + T.R.R.

Old Cop, do more of the distinctly human stuff. It's a vein that you have never + could never overwork (because of your natural artistic reticance), + you have decided power in that direction. I love your unhuman things too; but men in general will love you more for the human sympathy that is in you and that you so often conceal I don't mean much. I hate mush. Till we meet!

Always yours,

John
