                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt,</salute> 
                </opener>
                <p>As a result of a sight-seeing trio through the west in the summer of 1971 and reading Dee Brown's ,<hi rend="underline">Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</hi>, I became interested in the west and the Plains Indians. In pursuing this interest I found your wonderful, <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi>, and have since read all of your writings published by the Bison Press. I have enjoyed them immensely.</p>
                
                <p>I am a native of East Tennessee and wonder if anyone has immortalized the first great expansion to the "Southwest" in a similar form to your <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi>. This courtship with freedom was carried on by settlers following the great Wilderness Road into the Holston-Watauga-Nolichucky river valley of East Tennessee. Here they set up the first independently free government by native born Americans in the Watauga Association. From here they crossed over and fought the battle of King's Moutain which was pivital<sic>pivotal</sic> in the American Revolution. Following this they made an abortive attempt at establishing a state named Franklin which would have been the fourteenth state in the Union. The area is rich in historic lore and the events are full of drama. If I were so gifted I would write of it myself.</p> 
                
                <p>But I am writing to tell you how I enjoyed your writing, and add my congratulations to all the many honors that you have received during a long and productive life.</p> 
                <closer>
                    <salute>Sincerely,</salute>

                <head>Neihardt, Nebraska poet laureate</head>
                
                <p>Columbia, Mo. (<hi rend="caps">AP</hi>)&#8212;John Neihardt, Nebraska's poet laureate, died Saturaday at the home of a daughter in Columbia. He was 92.</p> 
                
                <p>He was literary editor of the St. Louis <hi rend="italics">Post-Dispatch</hi> from 1926 to 1938 and poet in residence and lecturer in English at the University of Missouri at Columbia from 1949 to 1965.</p>
                
                <p>He was the author of more than two dozen volumes of poetry, fiction and philosophy, many dealing with American Indian culture and customs. One of his most famous works was the epic poem "A Cycle of the West," begun when he was 31. Most recently, he had been working on his autobiography. The first volume, "All Is But a Beginning," was published last year.</p>
