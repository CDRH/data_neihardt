<salute>Dear Slade:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I do admire the way you make your retirement worthwhile. <choice><sic>Isuppose</sic><corr>I suppose</corr></choice> Nita went with you on the Atlantic voyage, did she not? I hope you went together. It's so much more fun to be able to say "lookie" when something interesting comes up. How seasick did you get? I was on the sea three days once in a big storm and I still feel like retching when I think of those mountains of water sagging dizzily toward the groaning ship. It was a good experience to be so thoroughly scared that I was no longer afraid. That sea was so big that it wasn't even frightening after a few hours.</p>

<p>I am so sorry you have to be disappointed in your publisher. I have the general impression that publishers are quite often disappointing. If you feel seriously that your publisher may be short-changing you you could, you know, have an accounting firm go over their account. They dare not refuse.</p>

<p>As for royalties, for the first time in my life I have been pleased by what I have received lately. If I were in the hands of a big commercial publisher just now I verily believe they would sell 100,000 copies of <hi rend="caps">BLACK ELK</hi>. All the public needs is to see copies for sale. I have heard prospective buyers who couldn't find anything to buy and even so, the sales ran up last year to near 35,000 without any publicity of any kind. This isn't big business but it is very pleasing to me.</p>

<p>Don't be disturbed too much about the royalties. You have the satisfaction of knowing that you wrote a good book and that it will help anyone who reads it.</p>

<p>Did I tell you about Dick Cavett? His Neihardt show comes off April 27. I have the whole 90 minutes to myself.</p>

<p>I appreciate your feeling about your dear brother. It's a noble story and I like to think of it. You did and do love each other.</p>

<salute>Please give Nita my kindest thoughts and keep the very best for yourself.</salute>
