                <p>That was a corking good letter, and it makes me happy to know that my comment on the dissertation made you happy. I know the feeling. But your gratitude is more than I deserve, since I was only trying to express my appreciation of a big job finely done.</p>
                
                <p>This "elderly gentleman" appreciates Bower's comment. The lady was thinking of the outside of me, and that is as she saw. Bower <del/><add>was</add> thinking of the <hi rend="italic">other</hi>, and that does <hi rend="underline">not</hi> grow<del/> older; it only becomes more and more <hi rend="underline">aware</hi>. I feel this so often.

                <p>In this connection I am reminded how fortunate Mona is, in that she was not compelled to rot her way slowly out of the physical body, as most people must do. I know this process is, in reality, no more to be deplored than the rotten of a ripe apple; but the apple, presumably, is not self-conscious and cannot compare

            </opener>
                <p>You see I wasn't able to finish my letter. Things got to happening, and I was doing some extra talking here and there, along with some extra conferences &#8212; and some weariness. Anyway, hello, dear Lady, how are you?</p>
                
                <p>First, your question about my mother's letters. During the period you mention, there would be letters to her sister, Lora, in Grinnel; but these would be lost. I have no notion that the surviving sons would attach
                    
                <pb facs="nei.j4c.22.22-26_0002b"/>

                    any value to the letters. Also, she would have written to Mrs. James Carey of Bancroft. They were <del/><add>bosom</add> friends. The Careys were a wealthy family, owning a big implement business. Mrs. Carey has been dead years and years; but her son, <del/> Rex, an old friend of <del/> mine, is living at Dalton, Nebraska. <hi rend="underline">He</hi> would be sympathetic &amp; would really care. Try him.</p>
               
                <p>I had a lovely experience with a small group of picked people at the Episcopalian church the other night. They asked
                    <fw type="curatorial">23</fw>
                    
                <pb facs="nei.j4c.22.22-26_0003b"/>

                    me to illustrate my religious concepts with readings from my poetry. I did not in the least intend to make this more than chattily casual. Spoke in a low voice, naturally, the group being small &amp; intimate. But, by golly, 
                    <hi rend="italic">it</hi> <hi rend="underline">happened</hi>! It was <hi rend="underline">one of those things</hi>. The group looked hypnotized and didn't seem to bat an eye-lash<sic>eyelash</sic>. I'm telling you because of your importance in my scheme of things; and you know I'm not boasting. I <hi rend="underline">don't</hi> know clearly why
                    
                    <fw type="curatorial">24</fw>
                    
                <pb facs="nei.j4c.22.22-26_0003a"/>

                    that sort of thing happens. It can't be intentional on my part, and I don't feel I'm that "good". The feeling is like being a little while in heaven, and I feel of no importance at all during, and, especially, after the event. It's the miracle of perfect communication for a little while.</p>
             
                <p>This seems to happen to some who watch my television program. I get this through verbal reports, largely. Dr. Scherr's sister, for instance, is reported as saying she felt "hypnotized". (This sounds funny to me, 
                    
                <pb facs="nei.j4c.22.22-26_0004a"/>

                    in a way. Is it the <hi rend="underline">sound</hi> that does it, I wonder. A woman told me her little girl in primary school watches every time and forgets to play with her hula hoop. I asked <hi rend="underline">what</hi> she could be getting; and the woman said she thought it was the flow of the verse. If so, that's important for it tends to justify my poetic form. There's a lot of comment, all of the same general sort. Only a small fraction gets into letters but those you shall see later.

                    I'm deeply interested in your review of the <hi rend="underline">Wars</hi> &amp; how I'd love to be hiding under a chair during your presentation!</p>

                <p>I've had a <hi rend="underline">brilliant</hi> idea! Sometimes I'm almost smart! It's this! I'll <hi rend="underline">buy</hi> a <del/> tape-recorder, and I'll be able to swamp you with material, as well as give full answers to your questions. It's the only way.</p>
