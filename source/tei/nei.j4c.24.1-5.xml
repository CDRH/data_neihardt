            </opener>
                <p>Thanks for another precious letter, friend, friend!</p>
                
                <p>I do hope we may be able to make the Nebraska trip. This may well be the last opportunity; but even if it is <add>(be)</add> so, and <hi rend="underline">we</hi> can't make it, whatever happens will be all right. We should, in such a trip, go first to Kansas City and look at all the places where I lived and where I went to school. Then we should go to Wayne, and afterward Bancroft. While doing this, we <del>will</del><add>would</add> automatically bring back, not only the factual story, but the very <hi rend="underline">mood</hi> of the time and place<del/>.

                    I would remember everything, I know. We should have my tape recorder &amp; I could talk about each place, this saving you the work of note-taking, which, at best, must be a bit sketchy. There's so much to get in this way. I hope we can do it, and as for expense, I have some money eager to be spent for such a <del/> purpose. It would be fun, too, and we could build some good memories.</p>
                
                <p>I am more than merely interested in your "visual <del/> thinking" about Skyrim. What you say makes it a bit less lonely around here. Everything is so beautiful with

Often the "wall" seems to become thinner, but it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a wall; and at times it is too easy to grow weary of living <hi rend="underline">on the wrong side of the wall</hi>. I don't want to do that, &#8212; <del/> I mean, grow weary. I must manage to get to work on something.</p>
               
                <p>Tomorrow I must talk at Fulton. I hope it's worthwhile. I'll try to make it so. Then on the 2nd of May I must be with Benton at Christian. I spent 25 years on the matter to be discussed, and I doubt that anyone else ever did. I will

                    heavy weather of the business.</p>
                
                <p>Some people from up in <add>Western</add> Nebraska phoned me yesterday, asking if they could have an hour with me on May 9th. They'll drive down &amp; back &#8212; 1200 miles &#8212; for that; and if they can make such an effort, I owe them my best. You <hi rend="underline">are</hi> busy! I know what you mean about Christian College. Bless their hearts &#8212; <hi rend="underline">they have all the answers</hi>! But so long as they are <hi rend="underline">kind</hi>f &#8212; and they seemed to be &#8212; the rest needn't matter, as you suggest (I'm worried ragged about Solomon and the authorship of Ecclesiastes! When you find out, will you promise to relieve my anxiety? <hi rend="underline">Please, please</hi>!)</p>

                <p>I've had Ted Weatherly out here two days. I think you know of his difficulty (He had shock treatment at Barnes Hospital.) We had a good time. He worked on my roses, and I cooked <del/> nice lunches. One day I caught a big bass and roasted it in the oven. Of course we had vegetables, <hi rend="underline">and biscuits</hi>. He's a good boy with an essentially <hi rend="underline">good mind</hi>. He just got to thinking about some things before he was ready for them, I guess; and he was not, apparently, born gifted with the lust for life. My god! To think of all I'd experienced at his age &#8212; and loved it!!

                    I <hi rend="underline">was</hi> lucky indeed. He likes to come out here, his parents tell me, and I like to have him.</p>
               
                <p>Don't wait to say anything in Greek! Say it in German, if a foreign tongue is <add>(be)</add> required.</p>
                
                <p>And, by the way, I'm having your Greek books repaired at the top of their spines. They will be coming along in good time.</p>
                
                <p>I often think of the House of Happiness. I'm so glad about it! In closing, let me say that I don't like you at all!!</p>
