                <p>I think and think of your coming for the dinner, and it almost seems <choice><sic>improble</sic><corr>improbable</corr></choice>; yet I believe it is quite true. Hurrah for Bryan! And a beautiful new dress too! Hurrah for McKinley and Remember the Maine! It seems we'll have quite a time at the dinner. Atherton tells me you will speak. Hurrah! I know it will be mighty good.

                <p>Tuesday afternoon (<unclear>last</unclear>) Lambert (in charge of television) and Librarian Parker, and I had a conference. (Sounds important) We planned our panel program for April 16. This is in connection with the library and

                <p>Here are some points that occur to me &#8212; biographical data:
                    Do you know about "Jim" Dahlman, the Cowboy Mayor of Omaha, and how he presided at an overflow meeting (really a sort of men's meeting) at the Omaha Library when I read 
                    <hi rend="underline">The Indian Wars</hi>? It <hi rend="underline">was</hi> quite an event, and must have been reported in the World-Herald.</p>
                
                <p>Have I told you about old Antoine Cabanne,

                    my <del>haf</del> half-breed friend in Bancroft? He was the son of the aristocratic Jean P. Cabanne of St. Louis and an Omaha woman. He and I were great friends back near the beginning of the century. He boasted that he was "the first white child born in Nebraska". He <hi rend="underline">was</hi>, having been born at old Fort Atkinson, but he was hardly "white", except in character. What a gallant man the utterly unlettered old man was! When he met my women on the street, he swept the sidewalk with his hat and bowed double. It was the old French aristocrat

                <p>And do you know about Gompers? Darrow, Tveitmoe, and Johansen? They <del/> used my Battle Cry in the famous McNamara case.</p>
                
                <p>I just happened to think of these people, and wondered if I'd told you about them. I must make notes as I think of people and incidents.</p>
               
                <p>I've been reading Mrs. Bennett's <hi rend="underline"><add>The</add> World of Willa Cather</hi>. It's a good job, but yours will be far far

                    <hi rend="underline">more</hi> <hi rend="italic">meaningful</hi>. I know Mrs. Bennett quite well. She lives in Red Cloud and has spent years in studying Willa's life, her relatives, her experiences there in the early days. <del>She</del> <add>Mrs. Bennett</add> and her teacher sister from California made a sort of pilgrimage here two years ago. If you should read her book about Willa Cather, you'd like it, but you'd be <hi rend="underline">greatly encouraged too</hi>.</p>
            
                <p>No more now. But didn't I tell you I would write you a lovely letter? Well, this is it, isn't it?</p>

                <p>Mrs. Bennett's Willa Cather book is not an organic creation. It's chief merit is in the material collected and its value in showing that Willa's youthful experiences in Red Cloud, Nebraska (1883-1896) furnished the substance and inspiration for her writing.</p>
                    
                    <p>I was immensely pleased in comparing your work and Mrs. <hi rend="caps">B</hi>'s, altho' I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> respect the latter for what it really is &#8212; and occasionally I admire too.</p>
