Dear Lady:

	<p>Here is a characteristic letter from Alice. I want you to feel her as she is. Note that old Lynn is pushing ahead with her violin. This is done, partly, with the idea of pleasing Nanny, who first taught Lynn. It is understood that Nanny's fine violin is to go to Lynn when she can play the great classics. This was Nanny's wish. The instrument is originally an

Amati, with modern repairs and additions. It's really a fine thing and its tone is exquisite. Will it not be fine to see old Lynn standing tall &amp; straight and blond with that violin under her chin??! In a year or two it will be hers.</p>
