<p>Dear Pal:</p>

	<p>It was good to hear from you again and to know that you liked the Alys. They <hi rend="underline">are</hi> very fine people - and very able too. Mrs. Aly wrote glowingly about you, John. She mentioned "the twinkle in your face" when you talked to her. I remember that "twinkle", John; and I'm glad it is still there! Mrs. Aly also wrote <hi rend="underline">most appreciatively</hi> of Edna and her husband. I'm so glad you all liked each other.</p>

	<p>Yes, I remember the diving into muddy Logan Creek - and I remember a heck of a lot more too! I appreciate your wish to pay for the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>, but it's a gift for old time's sake, John. You are a piece of my life, you know! I'm returning the  bill.</p>	

		<p>With the old affection,</p>
