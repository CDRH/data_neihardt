<p>My dear Mr. Davis:-</p>

	<p>I have just been thinking, since receiving yours
of the 6th, how fortunate it is to have a man, whom one has
never seen, trying to discover one! I have conceived such
a feeling of gratitude toward you that is my intention to
keep hammering away at you, that you may be the man who finds
me, if I ever find myself.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, this every day endeavoring to force a trumpet-
cry out of the throat of a gnat seems humorous to me. I have
long walks in which I laugh at myself- then I come back and
go at it again.</p>
	<p>Today I had a walk, and the result of it is recorded here:</p>

<p>I'm a roaming in the tall, tall woods;
I'm a yelling for to be found out:
I'm willing to deliver an assorted lot of goods
To the fellow that'll hear my shout.
I'm a ranting, nervous cuss, and I want to make a fuss,
I can soar as high as buzzard ever hovered:
It's my petted superstition I'm a genius with a mission -
And I want to, want to, want to be discovered!</p>

<p>I'm game to do the real right thing!
W'y, I'm even game to be damn good!
(If it's really very very absolutely necessary;
Or at least I'd be as careful as I could.)
I'm drunken with a hot mixed dream!
Here's a pile of chips on me - let's see it covered!
Do I think I'll reach the wire in a walk? Well I should scream!
So I want to, want to, want to be discovered.<p>

<p>I'm a virgin country aching for a plow;
I'm a howling coast anhungered for a sail:
I wish the Afterwhile would condescend to be the Now!
-Mr. Christopher Columbus, hit the trail!
Sometime I'll split the spaces with a yell
That'll sound as high as buzzard ever hovered:
And if I fail to do it, I will bow and go to- well,
I want to, want to, want to be discovered!</p>

	<p>All of which proves that all the good poems were not
written by Alfred Austin. You will notice with what consummate
mastery I have used repetition in the final lines of each
stanza, producing a sort of battering ram effect, and fairly
beating it into the head of the awed reader that I really
do wish to be found out. I confess that the morals of the
thing are a little askew, but at least they are as good as
Baudelaire's, and the whole thing is a great deal more
intelligible than the Frenchman's output. I have therefore
proven that the thing is, on the whole, as good as some things
in French and English.</p>
	<p>But, candidly, Mr. Davis, I rather think I can do something
in the line of the dramatic poem! Have been trying it. Do
you think I am wasting my time? I practiced verse long before
I ever thought of prose; began it when I was twelve years old.
I have quite a good deal of stuff, begun in the past three
years, that I think has something in it - maybe not.</p>
	<p>Thanking you for your interest in me, I am,</p>

		<p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
