<p>Dear Ones!</p>

	<p>It was a pleasant flight all the way, and I was cheated out of my $52,500 insurance - a fact which irks me a bit! But I almost beat the insurance company. We arrived at Columbia Air Port<sic>Airport</sic> on time; but when we touched the field, it seemed to the pilot that the landing gear was hay-wire<sic>haywire</sic>. The alarm light started going and the thing said 'beep-beep-beep'. So we circled Columbia for a half hour, hoping to shake the landing gear into shape - then

we headed back to St. Louis for a belly-landing, where we'd have proper fire protection. In St. Louis we had a 
<hi rend="underline">perfect</hi> landing. Then, in another plain<sic>plane</sic>, we flew back to Columbia, two hours late. I was almost a rich man that time !! $52,000!!!</p>
	<p>It was such a deep pleasure to be with you two in your home. You are <hi rend="underline">good</hi>. Bless you, and thanks, thanks. I'm now in my house on a lovely quiet day of sun. Had a lunch here for Enid &amp; Hilda. Fine time. There is <hi rend="underline">no</hi> sadness here. I <hi rend="underline">love</hi> the empty rooms. They are truly full.</p>
	<p>Do say affectionate, thankful things to anyone there who cares about me. Such wonderful people!! They make me happy. <hi rend="underline">Elders, Thompson, Wilcox</hi>, and all the others. Say very affectionate things to them. <hi rend="underline">And</hi> Mrs Olds too!</p> 
	<p>I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> hope the faculty backs Malotte generously. The situation makes

me feel like fighting. It's outrageous! Everyone here asked me about it.</p>
