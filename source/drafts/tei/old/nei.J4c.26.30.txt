Dear Slade:

	I have nothing new to say, but I feel an urge to tell you I am thinking of you and that you are dear to me. My classes are a source of pleasure, as usual. Our weather is perfect - golden days and colored leaves, with a tang of frost.

I'm writing this at Skryim, which I don't like to leave; but I must have the water shut off and the pipes drained. 

				Kindest thoughts for Nita

					Love always,
