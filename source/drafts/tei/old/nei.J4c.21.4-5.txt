<p>Dear Bower-Aly:</p>

	<p>I've been thinking about your proposed work on public speaking in America since the Revolution, and the thought is thrilling. It's a whale of a book - already <hi rend="underline">there</hi> for you to realize.

	<p>It was good to see you, but I do regret that Mona could not be with us. There'll be another time.

						<p>Your grateful friend,</p>
