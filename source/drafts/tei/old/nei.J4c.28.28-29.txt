Dear Perky:

	<p>I was <hi rend="underline">so</hi> glad to receive your good barky letter, and will you please thank your Boy for writing it. I can't write English too, and and my Boy is writing this for me. I think it is very nice of him; but it's little enough return for all I do for him. Night and day I do nothing but watch out for him and wonder what he

-2-

is going to do next, and will he let me go along, if he is thinking of going somwhere -?-?! It is fine that you have been doing so well with your growing, and I can hardly believe that you can reach up to your Boy's waist, and 
<hi rend="underline">he</hi> already five feet tall!! Good Gosh!! I'll bet you have <hi rend="underline">an awful big bark</hi> by now! My bark is the same as always, but of late I've had some much needed help with my barking.</p>

-3-

	<p>Since Lassie, the Collie who owns Erica, came back from Mississippi, she has taken over half of the barking and growling. You will recall that I am not a very big dog, and what's more, I am already too old to grow anymore; so I can tell you there were times when I could hardly get all the barking and growling done. I was over-loaded<sic>overloaded</sic> with duties, and often I didn't get asleep with <hi rend="underline">both</hi> eyes for days and days. I do love my Boy

something awful, and I could never forgive myself if a booger should attack him while I was asleep. But now Lassie makes my life <hi rend="underline">much</hi> easier. <hi rend="underline">And</hi> she has such a <hi rend="underline">deep</hi> dark-brown growl and such a get-out-of-here-or-I'll-eat-you-up bark that I feel perfectly safe in leaving 
<hi rend="underline">her</hi> in charge while I sleep.</p>
	<p>Do come and see me, Perky dear! I'll bet my Boy will be c-r-r-a-z-y about you when he sees you!</p>
