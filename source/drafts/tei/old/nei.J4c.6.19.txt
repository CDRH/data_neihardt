<p>Dear Mr. Mott: -</p>
	
	<p>I was very glad to receive your letter of yesterday, and was surprised to learn that you wrote me from McGregor, Iowa. This is the first letter I have received from you since you were here. During the past month two other letters addressed to me (both containing drafts) have been lost, and I fear that at least one other letter has gone astray.</p>
	<p>It's the best of news that you will write two articles about my work. The more the better: and especially when the work is done by a man of real understanding. I feel quite safe in your hands, Mott.</p>
	<p>The prospect for the success of the epic cycle is surprisingly good and grows better steadily.</p>
	<p>"The Song of the Indian Wars" is going on in a most satisfactory way, and I count it a great privilege to have so tremendous a theme to handle. Four hundred twenty five lines in four months! Two glorious years of work left! It's fine to be alive, have a big job to do, and know how to do it.</p>
	<p>Be sure that I am deeply grateful for your friendship and cooperation.</p>

				<p>Always yours,</p>

<p>My people were glad to be remembered and all send kindest regards.</p>


<p>I feel sure that you will have little difficulty in finding a place for the second article. Am eager to see both. The four Macmillan books (poetry) are all going into new editions.</p>
