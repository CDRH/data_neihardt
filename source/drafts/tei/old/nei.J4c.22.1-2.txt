<p>Dear Slade:</p>

	<p>It was <hi rend="underline">so</hi> good to hear from you again! But even when I don't hear from you, I feel your warm friendship and am strengthened by it. I note that you two have been enjoying the grandfather-grandmother feeling in your house. It's wonderful, and it makes up for many of the difficulties of living.</p>

On the 24th I'll talk to the teachers of St. Louis and St. Charles Counties, and later to a large church group in Kansas City. One of these days I'll send some pictures of our young horses. They are beautiful. Bourbon Stonewall (1 1/2 yrs old) looks like a horseman's dream of a perfect animal. Even when he stands and stares high-headed at blue sky, he makes one think of a high wind blowing.</p>

					  <p>Affectionate thoughts to both of you dear people -</p>
