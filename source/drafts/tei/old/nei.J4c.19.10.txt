<p>Dear Seymour:</p>

	<p>I think it's a swell idea to ask Masefield, and I should think he'd be nice about it.</p>
	<p>As for the Anthology, use my "Easter" from "Collected Poems".</p>
	<p>I finished <hi rend="underline">The Song of Jed Smith</hi> on April 16th, and the book is to appear in September. So the Cycle of the West is completed.</p>
	<p>I'm staying awhile at 9917 Emerson Ave., Overland, Missouri (suburb of St. Louis).</p>
	<p>Kindest thoughts for Mrs. Seymour and you - also, blessings on both of you!</p>
