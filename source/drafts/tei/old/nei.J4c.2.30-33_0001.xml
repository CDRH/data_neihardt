Dear Sterling:-

Your good letter reached me this morning, + I must say a few things to you while I'm digesting a lunch (!) of baked beans.

The first thing in </unclear> is to insiste that you stop + give us a chance at you when you pass through. Omaha is in your route, + Bancroft is only $1.46 more - 13 miles. You can do it nicely! I am poor, as you know, but always have enough to eat, + we can give the front of the house to sleep in, providing you can sleep on a couch + if you can't you are not the Scout I take you to be. Eh? What? Of course you can stop off!

So when are you due?
