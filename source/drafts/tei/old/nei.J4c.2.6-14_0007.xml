I am beginning to get some rather well-defined suspicious regarding the meaning of life and death. I was born <unclear> of being religious in the churchy sense could never pray on my levees in the way of my relatives. I could not do it <unclear> for a long while I thought I believed nothing about death. BUt something came over me. I beging to be almost certain generally - absolutely certain at times - that I am going somewhere, that I must be brave and develope, that I must be generous, that hate and fear are too heavy for so swift a traveller as I must be, and that poetry is necessary food by the way I have recognized in you a lean, efficient traveller I - and I called you "brother." It was good to hear the word sent back - through the fog - so cheerily.
