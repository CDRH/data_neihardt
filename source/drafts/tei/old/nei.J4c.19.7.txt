<p>Dear Friends:</p>

	<p>What a fine-looking family, and what's better, fine as you look! Mona and I were genuinely pleased to have a look at all of you. Many thanks for remembering us.</p>
	"The Song of Jed Smith" is nearing completion. Macmillans have wanted it for May publication, but any dead line<sic>deadline</sic> would stop me. So it will definitely appear in Sept. I should be through in Feb.</p>
	<p>Mona and I made a lecture trip to Boulder and Denver in Oct., returning down the Platte to Wayne. Thought of you but had to hurry.</p>
	<p>We are both still impressed with the fine work you did on the biographical study. Too bad the State committee <unclear>! But, who knows? The thing may yet appear in complete form, After the Cycle is out in a single volume.</p>

                      <p>Love to all of you!</p>
