How are you? Fairly happy? Fairly happy is enough in this stage of the long game.

Yesterday I invaded the country of the cottontails to some effect. Never need a shot-gun before - always a rifle; but I find that a shot-gun after a rifle is like prose after poetry - easy enough. However, I fancy a shot-gun won't teach rifle-shooting. Saw a gray wolf's a - going over a branch of slough-grass, but didn't get close enough for the scatteration again.

"Hugh Glass" is once more pushing on, after a week or two spent on a short-story. The latter is called "The Red Room Ware." I needed the money, damnit!

Always yours,

John.
