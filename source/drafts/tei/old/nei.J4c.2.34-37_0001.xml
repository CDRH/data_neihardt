Dear Old Man:-

After you left I had a slight touch of homesickness, or something like it. <unclear> for me. I am little given to lonesomeness. I am still enjoying your visit - it grows.
    
<unclear> may French's volume arrived, and I have devoured it. My favorite is the sonnet with the line "always the out hall is very still", but throughout I find a strangeness that lyric forty, or any poetry for that matter, should have. What a face that creature had! I know what you mean about her looks by lamplight.

Smith sent me his volume, as you requested. Will write about it later. Am very glad to have it.

Things are looking up about here. The cave + the back bedroom are finished + I have had some <unclear> walk <unclear> if I am not careful I shall find myself
