<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>It's good to know that you will soon be settled in the <hi rend="underline">House</hi>, and that then 'a stream of questions will flow my way'. I'll be <hi rend="underline">so</hi> glad to have the questions, for they will give me the nudge I need; and you may be sure I'll answer each as best I can. How good it will be to think of you three in that beautiful home!</p>
	<p>That <hi rend="underline">was</hi> good luck in Portland, finding <hi rend="underline">Man-Song</hi> and 
<hi rend="underline">Two Mothers</hi>, especially the former;

as for <hi rend="underline">Poetic Values</hi>, did I not loan you a copy? If I did (and I'm sure now I did) the one you have is yours, unless it is inscribed to someone in the family. It's that's the case, I have another for you. I must help find the others for you. I think I'll place a standing order for my "firsts" with big Eastern 2nd-hand stories, giving Enid's name so as not to play into the dealers' hands. (They might flatter me with high prices!) Yes, old Stewart<sic>Stuart</sic> <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a born book-hunter. He and Robin went after books last winter like veterans.

	<p>Yes, yes, yes (as dear Dr. House used to say, stroking his Van Dyke) that <hi rend="underline">was</hi> a wonderful week. I like to live it over, hour by hour. I'm too grateful for it to make much of the wish that we could have had more leisure to dream back old times. We <hi rend="underline">could</hi> have done it, and it would have been a joy for me and a great help to you. But I know you <hi rend="underline">felt</hi> a great deal; and it <hi rend="underline">was</hi> such a precious experience to return

to the old places with you. I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> wish we could know about Miss Lobb. Surely she <hi rend="underline">did</hi> come through Mona that time; and if she did not, how in the world is one to explain the matter away? And if she <hi rend="underline">did</hi> come, could she not know that I came back - that we came - with affection and reverence after so many, many years? It's beautiful anyway, Lucile, dear Lady; and I'm so grateful for it.
	<p>Yes, it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a marvelous world - so much more so, most certainly, than we now guess; and the same aspect of the world, I'm sure, is

pitifully limited. Have you thought much about the pattern that seems to have caught us up and brought us together with a purpose? ("Us" means the three of us). It's really too pat to be regarded as "accidental." (Here I really 
<hi rend="underline">don't</hi> mean to attach <hi rend="underline">too</hi> much importance to the 
<hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>. But, at least, it represents a consistent striving for something true &amp; good and beautiful, and somehow we've been tied together in the project.)</p>

Cornell University was here with me yesterday afternoon. I cooked supper for him - Turkey pie, French friend potatoes, waffles, fresh tomatoes. Hilda will have him for a lawn dinner today (Sunday). You're at Pullman. I'm sure 
<hi rend="underline">you</hi> know when <hi rend="underline">I</hi> was there; I've forgotten when, but I 
<hi rend="underline">was</hi> there. I recall the Palouse country. That made a deep impression on me. (But does that come <hi rend="underline">after</hi></p>
