<p>Dear Mr. Mott: -</p>

	<p>Yours of the 9th has just come.</p>
	<p>We did not think you unappreciative. On the contrary, we regretted that we could not give you a better welcome. Come again & plan to stay longer.</p>
	<p>I'm looking forward to the Dec. number of the Review.</p>
	<p>When the new edition of the "Friends" is ready, I'll send you a copy. This should be very soon, tho' there might be a delay.</p>
	<p>Braithwaite has asked me for exclusive rights to dispose of moving picture versions of the two narrative poems. He seems very enthusiastic. Now while I despise the movies in their present state, I see how B's idea could be of great advantage to my Life <illegible>, and I have turned him loose to do what he can.</p>
	<p>The enclosed Transcript article might interest you. Please return it in your next.</p>

		<p>Always yours,</p>
