<p>Dear Seymour:</p>

	<p>My son and I are leaving for a considerable trip East, and this time his wife will accompany us. We plan to be in Chicago over the weekend before the meeting with "the boys and girls". My son and his wife have friends and relatives with whom they can stay if there's no room for the whole expeditionary force in your territory.</p>
	<p>If you want to drop me a line about anything, do so at the following address, where you can catch me on <hi rend="underline">April 29th</hi>: General Delivery, Morgantown, West Virginia.</p>
 
                              <p>Kindest thoughts</p>
                               <signature>Jno.</signature>



<p>Almost forgot to thank you for the <hi rend="underline">twenty!</hi> Many thanks.</p>
