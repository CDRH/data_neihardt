Dear Old Man:-

How are you and what are you doing? When I last heard from you, the outlook wasn't merry; but I'm happy by this time you had got the grey again.

What of the world-Tramp you mentioned as a probability? It would be fine in a way, but don't you need a scholar's seclusion + quiet for your real work? Don't you think constant change of scene + The state of mind that wandering gives would tend Toward scatteration? No vagabond could have done your <unclear> sonnets.

Sterling, I think a great deal about you, you seem like a relative who has always been far enough
