<salute>Dear Comrade:</salute>
            </opener>
<p>No indeed, I am not wise, if by wisdom is meant the ability to be happy. Many readers of my daily stuff, and especially when I "let loose", seem to think that I do see causes and relations with more than the usual clarity. Also, I feel things that prove to be true, and in my journalism I have been several years ahead - in some cases fifteen - of the next swerving of the current. If this constitutes wisdom, I may have some. But I doubt the practical value of understanding basic things in a civilization like ours; for one who understands at all must feel practically convinced that, in the long run, terrible catastrophe is the price. My little article was not on life. It's title, as I remember, reads "Is <del/> the Truth Bitter?" I know <add>that</add> the truth, which is a matter of just relations as determined by human experiece, is not in itself bitter. It is beautiful and wonderful and worth suffering to know in any form. But if I were asked if life is bitter, I'd be compelled to say, <del>that</del> if I felt compelled to answer, that life in our industrial society is, for the vast majority, already of no worth, and I believe it will become for the vast majority a positive burden. Increasing activity with decreasing human meaning is the chief characteristic of our society. I am unfortunately placed in a position like this, for a great newspaper, and especially my job on such a paper, is a focussing point for every phrase of the contemporary consciousness, and the impact is terrible. But I love you and some others, and 
    <pb facs="nei.j4c.14.9-10_0002"/>
    <fw type="curatorial">10</fw>
    it is the ample truth that I could love anyone <del>or anythin</del> sincerely if the need for my love should arise.</p>

<p>I'm glad about your magazine. Silence is perhaps the answer that a god would give to all this turmoil and folly; but we are not gods, and the best our writing can do is to act as a cry to forlorn individuals here and there in the growing darkness - "Here too am I - and puzzled and still believing desperately that there are real human values to be cherished even in utter loneliness".</p>

<postscript><p>All of us were genuinely glad to hear of Mary's happiness. I know her husband must be a man of fine abilities, as this is a matter of common knowledge. That he is also the sort of man you can approve is better still. Don't let the race bother you even subconsciously - that, of course, is nonsense. The difference between the flower of the race and the kike is beyond measure, as I know from meeting  both types. What a really stirring and satisfying experience Mary must be having with him in his success! And what grace she can add to his triumphs! She has our most affectionate thoughts.</p>

<p>The Indian Wars was chosen as one of the 500 books for the White House library. The selecting committee was chosen from all parts of the country.</p></postscript>
