What did you do in Ann Arbor? How did you find your admirer? I mean Wyatt. Did you meet Sam Lockwood?

It was kind of you to remember mona in Chicago. + she appreciated your thoughtfulness.

Old man, I wish you + I  could take a couple of ponies + disapear into the little Missouri country - go through the bad lands that Sully crossed with an army corps, pass through the <unclear> Buttes region + follow Crook's line of retreat in the Sioux Campaign of '76. I wonder if it will ever be possible for us to bat around together like that for awhile. You would get as much out of it for your work as I for mine - probably more in the end.
