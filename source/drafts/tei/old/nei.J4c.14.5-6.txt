Dear Comrade:

	I have become well acquainted with a Philippine poet, M. de Gracia Concepion, who is now on his way to Manilla<sic>Manila</sic>. Yesterday I asked him to do an article for you on Philippine poetry, giving a number of representative things to be published therewith. He was eager to do it, and no doubt he has written you, as he promised to do. This should make a rather good feature, I should think. Of course, I told him there's no payment, and he was glad to throw in with your sort of magazine.

	I must send that article on Tolerance this week end<sic>weekend</sic>.##########

	Endless love,

Perhaps you will want to devote most of a number to Concepcion's stuff.
