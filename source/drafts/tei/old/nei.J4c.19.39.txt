<p>Dear Seymours:</p>

	<p>Hilda plans to get away next week, and she will reach Chicago in the afternoon of Wednesday or Thursday. She will phone you.</p>
	<p>It's dear and characteristic of you to have Hilda. I know how she will feel about you two, and I do think you'll like her.</p>

			<p>Kindest thoughts,</p>
