<p>Dear Mott: -</p>

	<p>I've just read the Grinnell article again - and its certainly exquisitely done. Some day you will do an extended thing, showing the goal I sought &amp; how far I came from it. You may begin when "The Indian Wars" is in print - who knows?</p>
	<p>I'm grateful for you.</p>

		<p>Yours,</p>

<p>N. Y. Evening Post &amp; Boston Transcript go strong for the "Wayfaring". The former calls it "an American Odyssey"!!</p>
