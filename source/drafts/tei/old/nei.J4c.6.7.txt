<p>Dear Sinclair: -</p>

	<p>"The Brass Check" is terrific. I do hope they won't make you the victim of a frame-up. I'm a bit worried for you. Lord! What courage you have! And what a work you are doing!</p>
	<p>I can distribute a dozen copies here at once, but I haven't the cash to send in advance. Send me a dozen in cloth, and I'll remit within a week after receipt. I'll probably be able to handle more later. This thing must get to the people.</p>

	<p>With all good wishes,</p>

	  <p>Yours,</p>

<p>Send  bill at once, so that I may know what to charge. - J. N.</p>
