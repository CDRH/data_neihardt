Dear Mr. Latham:

	Many thanks for your friendly letter. Altho<sic>although</sic> you make no promise, you do say that Macmillans will reconsider the matter of offering the 
<hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> to the public, adn that undoubtedly this will be done during the coming fall. I do hope that those who consider the proposition will actually know the 
<hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>. Figures on a balance sheet will tell nothing that they need to know in this case. As for the market, we all know that markets are largely a matter of contrivance in these days. When the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> is offered, there must be preparation. Among other things, it must not be taken for granted that reviewers will know anything about the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>, and it must be assumed that, even though they know nothing, they write as though they were thoroughly well informed. I can and will furnish the necessary article to be sent to all reviewers. One 
<hi rend="underline">brief</hi> reading notice, such as your publicity department sent out, would be ridiculously inadequate. This is only one important point. You as publisher, and I as book-review editor for 25 years, know plenty of others , and we are not naive enough to suppose that merit is enough in such a time as ours.
	I note that the one-volume edition of the <hi rend="underline">Friends</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Glass</hi> has done very well. It is the volume with which the Macmillans force has tried to do something.
	The curious aspect of this whole affair is that I am on Macmillans' side. It would be foolish to suppose that, as a business firm, you can afford to 
<hi rend="underline">print</hi> the volume of the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>, and then drop the matter, just when the purpose of years has been achieved. The fact of the war <hi rend="underline">can</hi>, &amp; <hi rend="underline">should</hi>, be used in our favor. The Trans-Missouri country <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a great and important part of our America; and if there ever was justification for invoking Americanism in support of a literary work, you have it in this case. We have a great deal of excellent critical comment on each of the volumes of the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>, even on 
<hi rend="underline">The Song of Jed Smith</hi>, and we should certainly make the most of that fact when the completed <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> is offered.
	Incidentally, I shall be ready with a suitable Introduction when you want it.
	Is it a certainty that the Book-of-the-Month Club could not be interested - or some other such agency? The Book-of-the-Month Bulletin has said fine things of the last two volumes.
	I do believe you are genuinely friendly to me and that you believe in the 
<hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>. That's why I feel free to speak out to you. The great Macmillan Company is being penny-wise and pound-foolish in this matter.
	I'm about to begin a lyrical thing to be called "I shall Be Young with You" - something I have kept myself from writing25 years. It might well be used as a dedication of the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>. 
		
			With kind thoughts always,
