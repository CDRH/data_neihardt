<p>Dear Slade:</p>

	<p>I have <hi rend="underline">not</hi> forgotten you, dear friend! I've been lecturing at the University of Oregon, have been back less than a week, and am still recruiting from the strenuous experience. I was very happy out there - first, because the climate is marvelous. It's more than half way<sic>halfway</sic> to heaven in the Willamette Valley, where it's always green &amp; the flowers bloom continually. Then, one of my wife's and <hi rend="underline">my</hi> dearest friends is there - bless her heart! It was the <hi rend="underline">next</hi> thing to seeing and being with Mona. They say out there that I'm certainly coming back - next year or maybe before. I'll go whenever they call me. I flew both ways and took my grandson Robin along. It was a lot of fun.

The weather was perfect both ways - golden, quiet; and the crossing of the Continental Divide at 19,000 feet was a great experience. While at Eugene, a Prof. of Western History took my friend and me over to the Umpqua River where Jed Smith's second party was massared<sic>massacred</sic>. We played a bit with the Pacific Ocean and had a fine lunch among tall pines.</p>
	<p>I talked four times and had two classes.

Everything goes well. I want to hear from you again. And how is Nita? You are dear to me - bless your heart!</p>

	<p>Tell Nita I often think of her, and I wish we could all have a "night-cap"<sic>nightcap</sic> together. Such things are so good to remember.</p>
