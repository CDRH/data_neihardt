Learned and Lovely Madam:

	Hereafter until further notice, in keeping with the expressed with and convenience of the Neihardt Entertainment Enterprise, Inc., of which you are the honorable secretary, I shall be born on the 8th day of July, all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. It is to be understood, however, that this change will be effective only in the Wilamette Valley of Oregon. In all other vallies<sic>valleys</sic> I shall consent

to being born on the 8th day of January.
	Indeed that <hi rend="underline">is</hi> news! Is it definite? Dr. Atherton came to my office several days ago to discuss the matter of my collection. I had <hi rend="underline">not</hi> contacted him, as I had meant to do. He had seen Ollie on some publicity business, and Ollie said something about the Congressional Library's request for the collection. So Atherton came to see me. He says they want to give me a contract stating in detail what they will do to preserve the papers - everything

the Congressional Library would do (For instance, each sheet of <hi rend="caps">MS</hi> would be enclosed between transparent sheets.) I told him all of the family agrees that my library should be offered to the Univ. Library. At that he really took fire! I asked him to write to Bower and you about his plan.
	I do very much like the idea of having all my stuff together in the new wing of the Library.

There would be a good place for Mona's bust too! I've been a bit under the weather, but am all right<sic>alright</sic> now, I think. Anyway, <hi rend="underline">dear, dear friends</hi>, you are in my mind so often, regardless of how often I write. It seems I have a large Epic America class semester. I had <unclear> made, and they are all take by the second day of pre-registration. More were made, of course. A Miss Ingels, who teaches in K. C., is getting her master's degree at the U. of Colorado, and her dissertation is to be on "The Epic America of John Neihardt." She was in my class five or six years ago, and is still enthusiastic.
	Tomorrow morning I say goodbye to my poetry class. They have all become friends, and they did good work. Two are very fine.

The course should perhaps be called " English <unclear>". I really teach all the standard forms and all the while encourage poetry. We do get good results. I must teach <hi rend="underline">Critical Essay</hi> next semester. It is more difficult, I think, than the poetry course.
	With the same love to you and each one in the family - including sweet, precious little Perky!
