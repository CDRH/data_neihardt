Dear Dr. Kendrick:

	Lyndal has heard the story of Mr. Stork and the Pickle Fork five times, and would have heard it more but for the fact that we've been having flu for a week. She says for me to say to you: "Many thanks for the story. I like it very much, and I think it pays to be polite."
	It <hi rend="underline">is</hi> a good yarn. We have not yet been able to read "The Holy Earth", but we are coming out of the shadow of the flu, &amp; soon we shall read the book aloud. Many, <hi rend="underline">many</hi> thanks for wanting to share it with us. You will hear from us.

				Kindest thoughts,

                                <signature>John Neihardt</signature>
