                <p>Every time I receive a letter from you, it's like a nice rain after a dry spell! Yours of the 17th was a sun shower &#8212; very good for this old man!</p>
                
                <p>There are so many things to say, that I don't know what to say first. Your comments on individualism mean a great deal to me. Indeed, I was <hi rend="underline">not</hi> influenced by existentialism. On the contrary, I have regarded it as another manifestation of the anarchic spirit of our time. When I was elaborating my thesis on the mood of our <hi rend="underline">time</hi> and its cause, existentialism had not yet become widely <del/> known and discussed over here. But I think of it as a further proof of my contention as found in so many of my articles in the P-D
                    
                    <pb facs="nei.j4c.27.26-29_0001b"/>

                    (and in the Journal-Post and even the Minn. Journal). In the P-D there must be several articles on the subject, as I remember; and you seem to have at least one in mind when you refer to the sort of person who thinks he is intensely individualistic &#8212; a non-conformist &#8212; when, in fact, he is <del/> <hi rend="underline">slavishly</hi> <hi rend="italic">conforming</hi> <hi rend="underline">to the dominant fashion among "sophiscates"</hi>. I recall an article on the sort of self-styled socialist who is anarchic in his thinking &#8212; while socialism connotes the exact opposite. This <hi rend="underline">is</hi> very common.</p> 
           
                <p>What you say about "a follower of the crowd" <del>is the</del> indicates that you must know
                    
                    <fw type="curatorial">26</fw>

                    some of my articles bearing on this matter <add>(Was this in the Goldenrod?)</add> I have have always been, in fact and in expressed theory, an individualist. But I have always <hi rend="underline">been</hi> profoundly aware that the individual is important only as a component of social and cosmic pattern. In Dr. House's book this was stated, as you will remember. This is it: <hi rend="underline">I</hi> am nothing in myself; but as a part of a vast pattern, I can partake of the greatness of the pattern; and I am under what I may well regard as
                    
                    <pb facs="nei.j4c.27.26-29_0002b"/>

                    divine compulsion to contribute as much to the pattern as it is possible for me, by effort and sacrifice, to contribute.</p> 
               
                <p>O Lucile, <hi rend="underline">dear lady</hi>, I've done that, even tho' what I 
                    <hi rend="underline">was able</hi> to do <del/><add>may not</add> matter very much; but I know it matters far more than much that was done under a different compulsion.</p>
                
                <p>I'm genuinely glad for the message from Old Man Stewart, whether he actually told you to send it, or not. I know he feels that way, and he knows I am deeply fond of him &#8212; if he ever thinks about the matter. He is going to be <hi rend="underline">such a <del>fine</del></hi>

                    <hi rend="underline">fine man. I know he is</hi>. And I'd feel greatly flattered if sweet, precious little Perky should have even the vaguest dream-like memory of me. She probably hasn't, but I'll bet she'll be sweet to me when I come back.</p>
                
                <p>Animals mean a very great deal to me (<hi rend="underline">Animals!</hi> How funny!) Somewhere someone has remarked that a profound love of animals indicates a nearness to the other world. I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> feel the thrill of truth in this. Last Sunday I went out to Skyrim to visit the darling horses. Four of them were obviously delighted to see me. They crowded against the paddock fence, thrusting their

                    noses <hi rend="underline">through</hi> the bars and striving to get all the petting, each for himself. They all wanted to be kissed; <hi rend="underline">and they got kissed on the soft place</hi> between the nostril and the mouth. It's a wonderful feeling. There's a touch of ecstacy in it!! The sweet things! Neither they nor I wanted anything in a selfish way. We just felt very close to each other.</p> 
               
                <p>Lucile, <hi rend="underline">that is something very good; And very beautiful too</hi>

                    Lucile, I'm constantly being surprised and delighted as I go about the campus and the town, at the way people treat me. So very many, whom I do not know, speak to me as though they felt affection. Why should this be? It frightens me, sometimes &#8212; for I fear I may outlive the feeling people have towards me; and I often wish I could <hi rend="italic">go</hi> <hi rend="underline"> before the mood changes</hi>.

                    I do hope my heart will give out in time &#8212; before an anti-climax can begin!</p>  
                
                <p>As for Perky, you just wait until she really gets big, and knows it! I'll bet she will take care of her precious family! I'd hate to be a <del/><add><unclear/></add> around there when she is in full charge!!</p>
                
                <p>Old Yo-Yo has some gray <del/> hairs, but she is still very active in social affairs, and the she often tells me where to get off!</p>
