<p>I've always loved your poetry but I also love the way you give it your wisdom, your humanity, your strength, your sense of honor and common sense, your <unclear>closeness</unclear> to nature and to God- all of this and more- you breathed into your short one hour (minus commercials).</p>

Sincerely, 
Doris Pinkerton Madden
