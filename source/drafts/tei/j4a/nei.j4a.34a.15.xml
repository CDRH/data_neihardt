Dear John:
<p>Mrs. Nancy Lankford, of Western Historical Manuscript Collection, University of Missouri Library, writes as per enclosed. I do not know where Syracuse got its microfilm collection of John Neihardt papers, and the people who could tell me at Syracuse are now gone. Can you help us?</p>
<p>With kind regards.</p>
Cordially,
