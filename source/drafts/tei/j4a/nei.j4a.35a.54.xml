Dr. John G. Neihardt
c/o Mr. Dick Cavett
ABC, New York

Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>We enjoyed your show last week very much with Mr. Cavett. My Mother was born at Ft. Robinson and knew of Crazy Horse and Gen. Custer.</p>
<p>You spoke of belonging to the Omaha of Indian Wars. Perhaps you knew my grandfather, Col. Charles Taylor, of the 9<underline>th</underline> Cavalry. Red Cloud surrendered to him and he was a friend of Bill Cody's and Calamity Jane's.</p>
<p>My husband and I send money whenever we can to the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota as a token for the great wrong done to the American Indians. Their language and their religion is indeed noble and I hope can be <unclear>perserved</unclear>.</p>
<p>If you have time, I would love to hear from you, and especially if you remember my grandfather, Col. Taylor.</p>
Cordially,
(Mrs.) Jean E. Bann<gap reason="cut off"/>
