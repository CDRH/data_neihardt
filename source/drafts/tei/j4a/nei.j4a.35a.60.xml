Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I'm going to the regular meeting of the Christian County Historical Society tonight. Many of us listened to your telecast on Tuesday, April 27 and we are very proud that we can claim you were born in Christian County, Illinois Your gift of four books is in the tall walnut bookcase of the "parlor" in the Museum. Only one room is complete - the <unclear>Haddell</unclear> bedroom. You see we have three buildings - the first Christina County Courthouse, the Museum, and the bee castle to work on.</p>
<p>Several eighth graders stayed up to hear your program, too. Miss <unclear>Brooerman</unclear> had taught your "April the Maiden" in her classes.</p>
<p>Your conversation with Dick Cavitt proves that even a ninety a person can be very alert if they only keep interested in this wonderful world of ours. Our white people wronged the Indians - it's too bad we couldn't have shared the land with them. Yes, there are problems today of similar nature.</p>
<p>Some of my friends are enjoying your record with me.</p>
<p>I just thought you should know you had a following in Christian County.</p>
Best wishes,
Dorothy D. Drennan
