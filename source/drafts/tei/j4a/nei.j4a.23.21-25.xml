                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I have been wanting to write you for some time but have neglected to do so. I'm not sure you will place me as you meet so many people in your classes, but I was in your Epic America class about two years back. If I remember correctly you wrote me a letter of recommendation when I drove a new car to the coast for the transportation. I can assure you it was one of the greatest experiences of my life to have the experience of <del>being in your</del> sharing your Cycle of the West with you. It was this that caused me to spend a year in the North West studying Indian

                    life and seeing what remains of their old encampments, etc.</p>
                
                <p>While there I became very much interested in the Nez Perce Indians. I visited many of their old camp areas and found many of their heiroglyphics<sic>hieroglyphics</sic> and drawings along the Snake River. It was very interesting to find that their late life, before they were forced on the reservation, so nearly paralleled that of the Sioux. No white man can ever really come to know Indian life without feeling humble.</p>
                
                <p>As I came in contact with their people and the remnants of their culture I could not help but feel we fail to realize there were great personalities among them too. I have come to believe more so that we have destroyed a great factor in our American heritage in handling the Indian Situation as we did.</p>
                
                <p>I came in contact with a Mr. Woods
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.23.21-25_0003"/>

                    at Asatin, Washington who has made a life study of the Nez Perce culture. Among other things he has made a chart mapping the locations of their writings along the Snake River that is rather complete. He has also photographed many of them and keyed the photographs to this chart. He also has a very complete collection of artifacts all of which are too valubale to be wasted.</p>
                
                <p>I suggested to Mr. Woods that, perhaps, the University would be interested in copies of the photographs and the chart, and he expressed a willingness to make them available. It seems to me that this material is of too great a value to be wasted. I would be glad to aid in any way possible if the university should be interested.</p>

                <p>The next time I am in Columbia I shall drop in to see you.</p> 
                
                <p>In the meantime I would appreciate it very much if you would write a recommendation and send it over to the University Placement Bureau as I am bringing my credentials up to date. You might stress scholarship and character as you knew me in class work.</p>
                
                <p>I hope you, your wife and family are all well.</p>
