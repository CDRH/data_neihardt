Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>"Great" is the word for your performance in Wayne. Very many people have told me yours was the greatest commencement "speech" they have heard.</p>
<p>It was gracious of you to permit the filming for our documentary, and to add Black Elk's Prayer later.</p>
<p>All best wishes from your Alma Mater.</p>
Sincerely,
