                </opener>
                <p>A happy new year to you and everyone! May this be properly celebrated by getting one out of your hair and into your hearts &#8212; which I <add>already</add> know are large and warm and comfortable! I hope your house has been bright and noisy for the holidays &#8212; with lots of <unclear>kids underfoot</unclear>.</p>
                
                <p>We appreciated your card &#8212; and I was pleased that your note read "<unclear>Do</unclear> write us!" instead of simply "Do write!" which <unclear>latter</unclear> forsee would most <unclear>properly</unclear> jolt me to another kind of writing! But I have been at it since Christmas, and finally have part one in rough draft, and Emma is pounding out some 70 pages on the typewriter. In the process I discovered that somewhere some important notes are missing and that my memory needs refurbishing. As soon as time allows me to read through what I have written, I shall make a list (not too long!) of questions for you to answer at your leisure.</p>
                
                    <fw type="curatorial">1</fw>

                <p>Now that I finally have set up part of the thesis, I find myself wondering if I could write a real biography. This probability<del>s</del> of error is frightening but fascinating. Or is it just that there is so much material that I am forced by my <del/> restriction to bypass?</p> 
                
                <p>Did I tell you what I have shown as headings for the three periods? You have become a Jesuit by figure! Postulant &#8212; <del>Novel</del> Novice &#8212; Professed! There are two other teams in the series, but <add><del/></add> the vows of the "scholastic" do not quit<sic>quite</sic> fit the hot young lyricist! But the local priest listened carefully to my use of the three terms (in fact he provided &#35;1 + &#35;3) and then declared that they united <del/> my line of interpretation precisely. So with his (lay) blessing. I proceed.</p>
                
                <p>I have been in correspondence with the government in an attempt to find some documentary evidence about Nicholas Neihardt. It will be of no particular use now, but perhaps later. "Correspondence" is <del>a</del> distorted to cover this action. I wrote a letter of inquiry about six months ago, and received at intervals five or six form cards with an <hi rend="caps">X</hi> indicating who had it or where it was going. So far

                    they haven't even found him but they are still at it. Should anything be discovered, I'll let you know.</p>
                
                <p>School reconvenes Tuesday. Selah! (Dictionary connects "selah" to musical pause; Father always implied that it meant something like "the mysterious will of God &#8212; so be it." Like Father like son!) I would a thousand times prefer to stay here in the study, but bread and the mortgage must be served.</p>

                        <item>2. Other than their names, I have no information (or images, anecdotes) about your sisters. Could you sketch me a characteristic anecdote of each &#8212; and <del>ages</del> dates of birth + death.</item>
                        <item>3. Do you recall the order in which you read Jacolliot, M&#252;ller, + the Upanishads?</item>
