Dear Mr. Neihardt,
<p>This year I am president of the Western Literature Association, and one of my privileges (there aren't really very many) is to nominate a distinguished writer of the West for "Honorary Life Membership" in the Association. Usually this person attends the annual meeting and speaks to the group at luncheon one day. I have nominated you, and the Executive Board has approved.</p>
<p>I hope that you will accept this honorary membership. It isn't a big thing, but it is all that we have at our disposal to use for honoring writers who have contributed a great deal to literature, especially literature of the American West.</p>
<p>Will you let me know the following as soon as possible:
1. Will you accept the honorary membership?
2. Would you be able to give a short (say thirty minutes) talk to the Association members at a luncheon honoring you on October 9, this year, at Red Cloud, Nebraska? If my information is correct, you have been Poet Laureate of Nebraska for fifty years, as of this year. It seems extremely fitting that we should be having our annual meeting in your country.
3. If yes to the above, cold I persuade you to talk on something that could later be published in the Association's journal? (<underline>Western American Literature</underline> is its name.) Perhaps something on the epics you have written.</p>
<p>I will be very pleased, personally, if you can accept this invitation. It is too long since I saw you last, when you were parrying my questions on television with questions of your own.</p>
Cordially,
<signed>John</signed>
