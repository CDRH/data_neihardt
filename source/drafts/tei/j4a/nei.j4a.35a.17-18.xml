Dear dr. Neihardt:
<p>Listening to your was like food or drink after a long hard March.</p>
<p>I am trying ot find your writings. The library is getting one book, the one you mentioned on T.V.</p>
<p>You must have earlier writings I am a bystic, and much interested in spiritual matters.</p>
<p>I know the real meaning of Mysticism, as I know you do.</p>
<p>I'd love to know more from one much wiser than I.</p>
<p>Life is lonely waiting to find spiritual relations - they are mostly among the young Hippies so called today, but who are really aware as you declared on T.V.!</p>
<p>I am in early sixties and became aware nearly 18 years ago, after much pondering.</p>
<p>I read the writings of Glenn Clark of MarAlester College in Minnesota.</p>
<p>I also read Everlyn Underhill_and Saint Theresa.</p>
<p>I read the religions, each one, <unclear>before </unclear>I turned to the Mystics.</p>
<p>If its possible to answer, tell me about your poems, where I can get them, and all your books. I recognize you as a <unclear>great Soul</unclear>. Your views on animal killing were also mine.</p>
My dearest wishes
Norma Conlin
