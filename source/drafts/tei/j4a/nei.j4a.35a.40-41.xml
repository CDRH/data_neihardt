Dr. John G. Neihardt
University of Nebraska
Lincoln, Nebraska

Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Your appearance on the Dick Cavett television show, April 27th, was a thrilling experience for me. I loved every word you spoke. When you chuckled I chuckled.</p>
<p>I felt excitement when you said "Forward is the direction." In fact, I jotted down several of your sayings. I could not help but feel your great spiritual power.</p>
<p>You see, I have a lively interest in you because in March I did a program on you for a few friends.</p>
<p>I am hoping that the story of your life will come out in book form. Want, so much, to have the privilege of owning and cherishing that book.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neihardt must have been an exectionally talented artist. The great Rodin accepted only the potentially great. I keep wondering if she might have known Malvina Hoffman, who was also a student of the master.</p>
<p>Thank you for the many hours of reading pleasure that you have given to me.</p>
Sincerely
(Mrs.) Grace C. Cook
