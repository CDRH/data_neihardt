Dear Dr. Neihardt:
I am doing a study of the career of Jack Wilson (Wovoka) the Paiute Prophet and am tryiwng to establish the hows and whys of the ghost shirt as it became a part of the ritual after it spread to the plains to tribes.
As far as I have been able to determine, Jack Wilson demonstrated his supernatural power as a bulletproof being-- as 1887. He wore an outer garment decorated with personal symbols, similar in cut to the Mormon Endowment Robe, and was fired at with a shotgun at close range. I ahve always assumed that visitors took teh story home with them and transferred the power to the shirt and symbols which made the quality of being bulletproof available to any wearer of such a magical garment. 
Last summer in deadwood, South Dakota, I saw a curious film which depicted the massacre at Wounded Knee. In it a Black Elk himself as the film was made in 1946 or 47, I believe-- takes full responsibility for the ill-fated bulletproof shirt. He seemed to be takign the blame for those who died at Wounded Knee under the illusion that the shirt would make them bullet proof, and  he did this in a much more definate way than he did in your book. I noticed that he was listed inthe credits of the film so he may have actually been consulted on the subject. 
Do you recall if in conversation Black Elk went into more detail on this point than is reflected in your book? Might something be contained in your papers at the University of Missouri? 
Sincerely,
Gunard Solberg
