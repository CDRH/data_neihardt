Dear John Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska 68505

Dear John:
<p>I want to express my unhappiness in not being able to attend the birthday party you had and I am afraid many were unable to attend because of the weather. In my case, I was at Norfolk, Virginia, trying to help a fairly new university there get on its feet. I also want to thank you tremendously for that Christmas present. While I had read all of the <underline>Cycle of the West</underline> and had some of the early volumes, I did not have the complete set and I am certainly glad to have them. The other volume I had overlooked and had not read. I shall do so with great interest.</p>
<p>I do have a few extra copies of my <underline>Senator Tellor</underline> which I published a long time ago. I am going to send you a copy.</p>
<p>We were particularly pleased with your inscription with the two book to us.</p>
Cordially and best wishes,
<signed>Elmer + Ruth</signed>
