<salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
</opener>

<p>What a joy to get your letter this morning. I know you are very busy. Dr. J. Golden Taylor who stopped here a few weeks ago said he planned to visit you. I'm sure there are visitors all the time. We have people ask about you often. They see your picture with the dedication address you gave in 1962 and they wonder how you are.</p>

<p>I'm glad you have the Aly manuscript at last. If you feel that the letters do not represent you properly, I think you should have them taken out. After all, some things are private and I should hate to have all my letters published. They could certainly give the wrong impression. I think you should have your way in this.</p>

<p>It is too bad that you can't publish the autobiography as you wished in separate small volumes,
but costs are prohibitive. YOu have your hands full for the next few years.</p>

<p>Thank you for your comforting words about our loss. My sister has had a difficult time adjusting. She was staying with one of her daughters who has a split level house, and stepped off one of the levels into empty space. She fractured her wrist and her foot. She is now with Norma(who you remeber) and in a couple of casts. It seems too bad that this had to happen to her, but the doctor says it may be the very best thing as it will serve as sort of a shock treatment and get her mind off her sorrow onto the problem of her own health. For a fact, she wrote me a few lines since this accident which is the first time she's written me since her husband's death.</p>

<p>Bill recieved a 3.71 average for his junior year. A perfect score is 4.00. He felt pretty good about that. He and his wife will be home thsi coming weekend. Now he is engaged in some research on muscle relaxant dealing with experiments on rabbits. He has a little more time on weekends and is making use of it by coming home. Jan is in summer school. Both will graduate next spring.</p>

<p>We plan to go to Williamsburg for our vacation the first two weeks of July. Alicia wants to see Colonial Virginia and Washington D.C. We will fly out and back, as the long driving trip would exhaust the doctor just one more time. People seem to panic. That makes for a difficult few weeks before we take off.</p>


<fw type="curatorial">36</fw>
<p>On Monday of this week a man from Des Moines was here to scout possibilities of an educational movie and film strip about Cather. He and his camera man will be back form the 23rd for a three day picture shooting spell.</p>

<p>On the 21st Frank Woods whose Charitable Fund gave the ten thousand to restore the Cather house is coming to visit the Memorial. He wants to meet all those connected with the Memorial. We haven't decided just how we'll hangle it. Harry and Hell Obitz will be home, and that is good. We are hoping his Fund will give us more to develop some of our other projects.</p>

<p>On Monday the 16th a scholar from Californiais coming to do a couple of days research on Cather. He's writing a book.</p>

<p>So we manage to keep busy.</p>
<p>The doctor and Mary Etta have been unusually busy it seems to me. They will need the two weeks rest more than I, as I can always stop and snatch a short nap.</p>

<p>Perhaps you and the Youngs can come down in August the way you did last year. That is, if you are not too busy with manuscripts. I know you are eager for the Aly book to be published and I am so glad to know you have it in hand at last.</p>

<p>Thank you for your good letter.</p>
