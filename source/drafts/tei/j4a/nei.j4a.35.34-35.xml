<salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt:</salute>
</opener>

<p>Congratulations! On your 90th birthday. And may you enjoy many more with good health.</p>
<p>You don't know me--and I have know who you are, as far as locale, only since Saturday, October 11, '69---about 3:30 in the afternoon---when my wife and I stopped at an historical marker, on Highway 51 just south of Bancroft. to my regret, now, I failed to copy the words of tribute, but I did note writer, poet, poet laureate and added "have to look him up."</p>
<p>The fact that I didn't know you long before this is no compliment to me. There are some important facets of life that, due to my ignorance, have begun to emerge late in life. You see, when I was a college student in Kansas and Oklahoma---1924 through 1928---I thought, like so many do today, that mathematics and physics made "my cup of tea," and I needed little else. I have enjoyed my forty-five years of teaching, + administration work, in both public schools and college, but I began to realize, some twenty-five years ago, I was missing something. (For example, I'd go to a book review on Santayana or a tea for Robert Frost, and I was lost. And I noticed, too, that in smaller groups my friends were asked to play, read a poem, or sing, and I never once was asked to find "the derivative of the product of two functions" or even "solve a quadratic equation." This hurt my ego, I guess).</p>
<p>I guess for my head-start was poor. Due, no doubt, to the dearth of reading materials in both my home and early schools as my father moved from place to place, over three states---Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma---in the "short-grass country." But, unknown to me at the time, I was developing a love and appreciation for the plains country that now, with my increased reading and travel, make living just more beautiful.</p>
<p>And Nebraska is playing a part in my enriched experiences. It happened like this: Some seven years ago, two people from Nebraska, Lowell and Lota Winter, moved two doors west of us here in Inglewood. Lowell is from Knox County, born near Bazile Mills, and Lota from Madison County, about nine miles southeast of Tilden. Through them I have experienced, vicariously, your state. By reading NEBRASKAland, the Creighton paper, the 1967 NEBRASKA A Pictorial History, several books from the library and visiting with relatives and friends of the Winters, I feel that I know much about northest Nebraska. Then the trip there in '69.</p>
<p>Harold and Elena (nee MUffly) Wagner, who live four and one-half miles southeast of Tilden, came over and told me <sic>goodby</sic> just before returning home. Nola, my wife, and I were leaving for New England in a few days. I asked Elena if she would make me a cup of coffee if I would come back by Nebraska. Well, I did and she did--200 miles just to get a cup of coffee and see Nebraska for the first time. What a wonderful experience! A pleasant visit with the Wagner's and their son Kenneth, home for the weekend form Wayne State; two days snow-bound in Norfolk; and a tense but memorable drive south through Madison to Columbus and Grand island. (This included ten miles of dirt detour south of Madison). Then through the snow to Cheyenne and Denver.</p>

<p>Then, when I got back to California, I began to collet information on you. Two books from Lota (Muffly) Winter---one, THE SONG OF THREE FRIENDS  THE SONG OF HUGH GLASS was used by Lota in the rural school, Dist. No. 27, in Madison County. The other a history book. I found three of your poems in two of my own books. "Envoi" and "Prayer for Pain" in Hill's THE WORLD'S GREATEST RELIGIOUS POETRY; "Let Me Live Out My Years" in McNeil adn Zimmer's LIVING POETRY.</p>
<p>Now, if you have read this far, may I ask a question or two? Is there available a complete collections of your poems? And second, have you completed your memoirs?</p>
<p>(After I asked that second question, Lota Winter brought me the January issue of NEWS from Wayne State---the one with your picture and the article about your Birthday. About three weeks ago she gave me your address and told me about the article. From it I see that you are now working on your memoirs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Winter has a brother, Dr. Charles Muffly, M. D., who lives at Pender. I think he, as well as Lota (Muffly) Winter, is a graduate of Wayne. He comes out to visit here quite often.</p>
<p>As you say in your 1915 introduction to The Song of Three Friends and Hugh Glass, I know my "Present is, in a great measure, a heritage form (my) Past," and I feel that maybe in my veins there might be some of the blood of those who help make your great state, for my grandfather was born somewhere west of the Mississippi---perhaps in Iowa---in 1837 and went from some place near Greeley Center to Texas just before the Civil War.</p>
<p>Again, I hope for you a good year and health.</p>

<note>We are leaving for Denver, to ge our daughter, in about two weeks. From there we'll go out toward Kansas City and then south to Oklahoma. If I should happen to be in Lincoln, do you suppose I could come out and have a cup of coffe - if Mrs. Young doesn't object?</note>
