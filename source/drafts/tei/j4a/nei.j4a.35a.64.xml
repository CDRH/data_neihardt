Dr. John G. Neihardt
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska 68505

Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I have just received in the mail a reprint of the Honorable Charles Thone's resolution entered Wednesday, April 21, 1971, in the Congressional Record. This is indeed a fitting commendation to mark your fiftieth anniversary as Poet Laureate of Nebraska. You have brought honor to all of us and glorified our State.</p>
<p>Not being a stay-up-late person, I had never heard a Dick Cavett Show before watching his interview with you. While it is always a privilege to hear again your readings and reminiscences, my greatest pleasure was watching Cavett's delight of discovery. You were a new sun on his horizon, and was he basking!</p>
<p>Congratulations on all the well-deserved honors.</p>
Sincerely,
Mildred Goosman
(Miss) Mildred Goosman
Curator, Western Colleciton

<p>Give the Youngs my best regards. I'm looking forward to my trip to Lincoln June 7th.</p>
