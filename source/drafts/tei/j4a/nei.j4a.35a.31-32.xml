Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>What a great enjoyable evening April 27th was for me.</p>
<p>My big regret is that my two granddaughters did not hear and see you give the very wonderful poem "Crazy Horse" in way it could be understood.</p>
<p>I have your Lyric and dramatic poems, now, must get Black Elk Speaks.</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
Sincerely
Blanche A. Cole
3102 Fontenelle Blvd
Omaha, Nebr. 68104
<p>Hope that K.E.T.V. will have your program on in daytime so the children will have chance to see again a big Thank you.</p>
