Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>I have just finished watching your interview with Dick Cavett on television. Thank you for your words and for sharing your life. Thank you also for your books; although I have not yet read them, I know that they will have meaning for me.</p>
<p>I am eighteen years old, and what you said about young people searching for religion is true about me. I think part of my loss and uncertainty is because I have gotten too far away from the land. The Indians lived close enough to the earth to grasp the meanings of the only real things of life. And all the so-called civilization and wealth of material goods are nothing without the knowledge of the "unity and holiness of all life."</p>
<p>It was strange and wonderful to hear you speak of personal experiences with people and events that are chapters in history books to me. It was stranger and more wonderful still to hear you, at ninety, raise the same basic questions that I have begun to ask myself at eighteen. But you perhaps have found your answers while I am only starting to know how much there is to ask and to feel and to live.</p>
<p>Black Elk might have liked to know that his words and his life will touch me through you. Thank you.</p>
Gratefully,
Cynthia Browning
