Dear Friends-
<p>Thanks, many times over, for yesterday's treasured hour at your house. The gracious welcome felt as warm as the glowing fire. Dr. Sandall and I learned so much from each one of you. It is indubitally true that the Poet makes all men see.</p>
<p>WE appreciate your time and concern. Especially do we appreciate the autographs, Dr. Neihardt. Generations yet to be will honor these volumes!</p>

<p>I have sent a memo to the office regarding the painting and trust you will soon be hearing about it.</p>
<p>Mr. Dalrymple, our Director, will be officially acknowledging the gift of Mr. House's "John G. Neihardt, Man and Poet" but I extend my personal gratitude also.</p>
<p>We are so excited over the possiblity of the gift of "The Divine Enchantment," and would assure you that the Nebraska Author Collection is a permanent one.</p>
<p>We are getting nearer and nearer a complete colleciton of our Laureate's works!</p>
<p>Now we look foward to welcoming you in the McKelvie Room and introducing you to our distinguished Nebraska Authors.</p>
<p>Dr. Sandall joins his gratitude with mine.</p>
