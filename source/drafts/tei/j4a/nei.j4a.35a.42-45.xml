<p>I have sympathized with the American Indian and the problems he has endured. I support two Indian Mission <sic>Charitys</sic> and have friends who are Sioux and were</p>

<p>reared on the Rosebed Reservation, so I am aware of the plight, social and economic of the people. Through your works you give respect that is due this great race of people.</p>
<p>It is rightfully so you are the Poet laureate of Nebraska for indeed your presence in this world enriches it. Your legacy of works are for all generations and far reaching. I might add I have relatives residing on Morrill Avenue and frequently visit Lincoln and Omaha and feel</p>

<p>Thank you again Dr. <sic>Niehardt</sic> for your literary endowments and your <sic>philosophys</sic> which elevate mankind and this world in which we live. We can always hope mankind will someday walk the road of peace and live as brothers.</p>
<p>Wakon Tanka must be most pleased with your works in behalf of His People. He has taught you to walk the soft earth; sweetened your heart, filled you with light and given you</p>
