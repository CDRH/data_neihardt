Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>Being an avid fan of yours over the years, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your recent laurels. They are justly deserved and not adequate as compared with the pleasure your works bring to your followers.</p>
<p>I am associated with an organization named the Old West Trail Foundation. We are planning our 7th annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on the 4th, 5th and 6th of October. We would feel extremely honored if you could speak at one of our dinners, either the 4th or 5th, and talk to our group for a short time.</p>
<p>We realize that you are tremendously busy, and that perhaps your schedule would not be adaptable to such an arrangement, but we would sincerely appreciate any consideration and response you so deem.</p>
<p>Again, congratulations, and many more years of sucess and peace.</p>
Cordially,
