<salute>My dear friend &#8212;</salute>

<p>Before me is this prized invitation to be at your birthday party last Sunday. My, how I wish it could have been possible to have come in, called out "Happy Birthday Gak". I really did just that, only I had to do it by thought and sunbeams across the miles.</p>

<p>I know the occasion was delightful, and I know that many more there who will mark this day as a special highlight in their lives because you were present.</p>

<p>Incidentally, just a few days ago I was ruffling through all my Civil Service papers, some needed &amp; some ready for File 13. Guess what &#8212; ther was a copy of the letter you wrote to Mr. Vernon Beggs in my behalf &#8212; way back in the summer of 1947!! Such positive thing you described about me ! &#8212; Instantly, they became a mirror into me and I "stood

me up" in front of the recommedations. There is much yet to do and to reach for.</p>

<p>Now with the holidays over and recorded, I push forward June when school closes and people go on vacation. Do you have plans for Phoenix and points Southwest? &#8212; As I recall last year June, I spent the greater part of it in Brigham City, Utah, attending a recreational workshop. All that time I wondered if you had come thru Alb. while I was gone. Are there any plans for such a possibility this coming summer? I shall truly hope so, and I hope also that you will earmark some time for here.</p>

<p>Christmas was spent in Mo. &#8212; 3 days all told &#8212; with my mother, brother &amp; his family I drove much too fast going &amp; comoing even to squeeze 3 days from my bfief time off from my work. My thoughts continued up to Columbia &amp; you &amp; Hilda, but my poor old body could not follow! &#8212;</p>

<p>I don't recall if I've ever told you or not but since my memorable visit with all of you, I have not been teaching here at the Indian School. Instead, I inherited the new girls dormintory which makes me responsible for 256 girls ranging in age from 8 yrs &#8212; to 20 years or so. Wow! What a job &#8212; "dean of women," adviser, disciplinarian. Mother confessor, nose wiper &#8212; etc. &#8212; etc. &#8212; But then, I wanted to work with Indian youth <unclear/> how much closer can one get than that?? Come over &amp; I'll give you a real run-down on dormitory living!!</p>

<p>My friend &#8212; again many I say a Happy Birthday even tho the official day has slipped by? In your life, each day is a happy birthday &#8212; Extend my greeting to dear Hilda and her family &#8212;</p>

<closer><salute>My love and my thoughts to all of you. &#8212;</salute>
