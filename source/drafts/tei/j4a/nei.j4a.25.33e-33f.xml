                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>  
                <p>I wanted to write to you before we left, but I am the official packer for the family and there was just too much to do. We are in Berkley tonight on our way home, and it's the first free moment I've had. Berkley is beautiful, but they tell us it is much more heavily built up than a few years ago. This whole area is too built up to live in now, I think.</p>
                
                <p>The poems enclosed are from the <hi rend="underline">Blade</hi>. I thought you might like to see them again, and I'll make copies of anything else you would like. The Eliphlet Bute one has some gorgeous lines &#8212; the "certainly best/ For my health and the place where I sat" are my favorites. The McKinley poem was reprinted in the <hi rend="underline">Blade</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>The <hi rend="underline">Blade</hi> during your year is a prize. It reads as if you were having a fine time, but the campaign against Graff was not as bitter as you remember it &#8212; in fact it seems obvious to me that your heart was not in it, and the whole political wrangle was distasteful to you. The only time you really lowered the boom was in the article on gossip.</p>
                
                <p>I found the lecture on Keats. It was given for the women's literary club and then <unclear>evidently</unclear> repeated for the literary association. Do you remember it at all? It was in 1907.</p>
                
                <p>This is news: Mrs. Ryskind gave me the whole collection she has, to use so long as I need it! I have put it into order by dates, but as yet I've read only a few letters. The ones I've seen are wonderful, though

                    We liked Mrs. Ryskind very much. She was lovely about everything, and says to write if I run into any questions she could answer. She talked of all of you with great affection, and asked me to send her regards.</p>
                
                <p>I do appreciate your writing out your ideas on socialism and totalitarianism for me. You'll be interested to see the sheets I have of your political opinions; I have <unclear>collected</unclear> them from your letters and put them all together. The <unclear>views</unclear> are still to be added, but I may make a separate lot of these statements; they will probably parallel the others.</p>
                
                <p>After we get home and see the mail I'm sure I will have more news. Everywhere I go I find people who know and admire your work; a teacher of interpretation in California is very sorry now that she didn't get acquainted with you when you were in St. Louis. She <unclear>taught there</unclear> during the time you were with the <hi rend="underline">Post Dispatch.</hi></p>
                
                <p>I do have a few more questions, if you don't mind answering. The first is about the lectures at the University of Nebraska that were the basis of <hi rend="underline">Poetic Values</hi>. Were they always supposed to be in October, or were they originally planned for April and then moved to October? Do you recall what the original <hi rend="underline">three</hi> were titled? The first two were the ones combined, weren't they?</p>
                
                <p>The second question (or set of questions) is about Greek. When you were reading it, and you read my Plato in the original? I ask because Plato's conception of poetry and how it is written is so much like the <unclear/> chapter in <unclear/> and like your own ideas. Also, did you read Xenophon in the original? If not, I'd like to know the translation. I'm wading the <unclear>Dahyno</unclear> edition &#8212; I only wish I could read it in the original!</p>

                <p>Again thank you for <unclear/> questions so <unclear>patently</unclear>. I am very happy to be doing this job, and I <unclear>feel fortunate</unclear>. I've met all sorts of lovely people who are your friends, and best of all are your letters.</p>
