Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>Congratulations upon your brilliant performance last night on Dick Cavett's special show! You were handsome and certainly at your very best! You seemed very poised and self-assured. And to think this will be seen by the nation.</p>
<p>Please thank Mrs. Young for reminding me, but I'd not forgotten the special day.</p>
<p>Your family must be terribly proud of your performance as all of us were.</p>
<p>By the way, who was your hairdresser? Your hair was so pretty!</p>
Sincerely,
Ethel Sweet
