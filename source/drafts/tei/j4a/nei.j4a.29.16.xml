                <salute>Dear Friend,</salute>
                
                <p>Your wonderful letter came this morning and I am accepting your "invitation" to write soon!</p>
                <p>I am anxious for more new of you all. The years have closed up andit seems only yesterday that we sat before the fire and enjoyed so many delightful subjects.</p>
                <p>I think often of the visits in your mother's home. Wasnt' she fun! Now that our mutual interests have been refreshed, I find myself scampering like a child, down one path and then another and almost shouting, "OH don't you remember"!!??</p>
                <p>I wished very much to be at your birthday dinner, and I was so happy for you. You know that only your mother was ever more anxious for the honors you deserved to be given while you were alive to enjoy them! WE all know that you will "know" and enjoy them in the long future, but there is something ber normal about receiving deserved praise while one is "in the flesh" somehow!</p>
                <p>I am enclosing a duplicate of the notice in the Chicago Tribune that we saw with such delight!</p>
                <p>I am so happy that the University is preserving your manuscr-ipts and papers. I shall look forward to seeing the Collection when it is arranged. (Unless of course it will be after your passing, in that case I do not "Look forward to seeing it"!!)</p>
                <p>Where was the dinner held? Please tell me more about it?</p>
                <p>Tell me also about the children and grandchildren, is Mona there? One hesitates to ask after so long a time, so much can happen. I have thought of each child and wondered about their lives. You were all such a close, congenial family.</p>
                <p>Nelson has made a beautiful life for himself and his family, you know he has always been a joy to me. They live just five minutes from me and each weekend my two grandchildren pack their suitcases and pretend they are visiting me in Florida and come spend precious days with me. They are seven and eight years old, are brilliant and talented and we have fun.</p>
                <p>As you know, we find Chicago a stimulating place to live and the country atmosphere of Kenilworth and Wilmette restful.</p>
                <p>The Public Libraries are very fine, our concerts good, I enjoy the people nearby and the years fly!</p>
                <p>I know that you have many letters to acknowledge an dare busy, but do write when you can?</p>
                
                <closer>
                    <salute>Love to you all, and many, many happy years to you,</salute>
