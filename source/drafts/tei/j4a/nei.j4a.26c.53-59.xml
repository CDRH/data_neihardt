                <p>And it was a joy to me to hear from you tho<sic>though</sic> your news about Mona saddened me and even from so far away I feel her loss. All thru<sic>through</sic> the years I have cherished a beautiful memory of her charm and goodness.</p>

                <p>This was to have been a real letter but I can't finish it now &#8212; had to stop and write to Uncle George and Aunt Stella. You knew of course Uncle Geo. married again and we think Aunt Stella is a noble woman. She isn't at all well herself but manages to take beautiful care of Uncle George who is

                    now bedridden. She is really one of the unknown heroines &#8212; can make even serious situations seem ridiculous &#8212; we have great admiration for her &#8212; and I spend considerable time writing to her because she <hi rend="underline">says</hi> my letters are a help.</p>
                
                <p>Tonight the local chapter of the American Academy of Optometry is giving <del>him</del><add>Frank</add> an<del>le</del> Honorary Life membership for his teaching and research. His research in the eye goes back to the '20s. It is wonderful that he can still teach in this private college that has no age limitation. Tomorrow morning early &#8212; I hate to think how early &#8212;

                    we leave by train for Berkeley where we shall spend the weekend with the children + grand &#8212; the reason for the trip is the meetings of ophthalmologists in San Francisco Mon. + Tues. where Frank is to give a paper. It will be fun to see the children.</p>
                
                <p>John, there is a high <del>mountain</del> Canyon <del>(</del> 5,000 ft up the side of Mt. San Gorgonio &#8212; 80 miles from Los Angeles where the settlers have raised apples for a hundred years &#8212; and <hi rend="underline">such</hi> apples &#8212; Arkansas Blacks, Delicious and Winter Pearmains &#8212; and make cider. The season opens the first

                    of October and even Frank is willing to interrupt his work to visit that lovely place and load the car with the good things it has to offer. If he is too busy I drive up alone.</p>
                
                <p>Before Christmas and during the Spring vacation we go out to the desert. The wild flowers grow in unbelievable profusion &#8212; miles of them &#8212; and at Christmas the sunshine is warm and cheerful. If I am so minded at other times I drive down to the ocean! The only <hi rend="underline">good</hi> thing I can say for this ugly sprawling town is that <add>(from it)</add> the desert, the mountains and

                    and the ocean are easily accessible.</p>
                
                <p>I have ordered <hi rend="underline">When the Tree Flowered</hi> and plan to get the complete <hi rend="underline">Cycle of the West</hi> very soon. Thank you for telling me. To think I did not know! I cherish all your books and particularly the joy of having your name in them. I would love to see your television program. It sounds exciting.</p>
                
                <p>This morning Frank is seeing some of the seamy side of teaching because he is correcting Examination papers. He just asked me to read one of the answers he was struggling with and when I couldn't understand, he said the student <del>w</del> had tried to

                    memorize the definition but had the verbatim wihout the sense! Do you have to struggle with papers?</p>
                
                <p>Now, I see my pen suddenly took charge after I said I couldn't write any more. <del>now &#8212;</del> I really didn't want to leave your letter unanswered till we return next week.</p>
                
                <p>Much love to you and yours from both of us</p>
