Dear Mr. Neihardt:
We have located two additional items of correspondence between yourself and George Seymour and I am sending copies on for your use. Our archivist has already forwarded these, as well as all others, to the University of Missouri. I hoep they will be interesting and possibly useful. 
I hope this finds you well and enjoying another Nebraska Spring. My parents, who live in Grand Island, are visiting and tell us that the remarkably mild winter we had this year in Illinois was not shared by Nebraskans. 
My very best to you. 
Sincerely,
Douglas L. Wilson
