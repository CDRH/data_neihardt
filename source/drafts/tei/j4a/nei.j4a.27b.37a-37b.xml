                    <salute>Dear John:-</salute></opener> <p>It was so <hi rend="underline">good</hi> to hear from you, my dear friend, and then to learn all the good things that have been happening to you. I know you must have been happy with Alice + the children &#8212; you didn't mention the horses but I feel sure that they also contributed to your pleasure. Maybe, too, the watermelons were ripe. And how fine all <unclear>this</unclear> <unclear/> recognition of your work &#8212; television rights, publication in far away Czechoslovakia, poetry <unclear>judging +</unclear> Texas. Surely the fruits of all your years are <unclear>ripening</unclear>, and the harvest is good.</p>
                    
                <p>Yes, I know Skyrim is beautiful and yet as you express it "so damned lovely". Yet it is <del>rich</del> redolent of sweet <unclear>memories</unclear>, too, <unclear>memories</unclear> never to be taken away, and always in your heart.</p>
                
                <p>How nice that Mrs Aly is coming, and in full pursuit of material for your biography. You will enjoy that trip to Nebraska with the revival of earlier experiences and thought.</p>
                
                <p>How <unclear/> we have been this summer! Sometimes I call it "the last summer", though I don't really mean that. The painters, plumbers, and carpenters moved in over Jun 30 and stayed
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.27b.37a-37b_0002"/>

                    until after the first of August. We have <unclear>owned</unclear> the house only since 1952. It had been greatly neglected for the <del><unclear>previous</unclear> 4</del> preceding 47 years of its life. We have been improving it, and this summer we made the last big repair needed. But now everything is done. What a job! You can't hire a painter to scrape paint in a hot attic or a carpenter to clean floors. Both Nita + I worked almost as hard as the workment but at <unclear/> tasks.</p>
                    
                <p>And now how I appreciate my office. There I can sit in the quiet and read + write. I have been asked to testify <add>in Washington</add> before the Committee on Ways + Means this fall. So I am fixing up my piece.</p>
                
                <p>As I write, I hear through the back screen door the strident humming of the cicada and the <del>quieter</del> subdued yet incessant chorus of the smaller insects They tell me that the high noon of summer is past, and that it is now 3 oclock or maybe 3:20 in the afternoon of the year. I always note with keen interest the signs of the passage of one season, and the coming of another, and strive always to be in deeper harmony with the great outside world that proceeds apart from man and all his works.</p>
                
                <p>I shall be in Missouri Aug. 28, arriving by bus from St. Louis. I'll call you shortly hoping to arrang a visit. You always give a lift to my spirit, as well as stimulation to my thought. I trust that your health continues to be good.</p>
