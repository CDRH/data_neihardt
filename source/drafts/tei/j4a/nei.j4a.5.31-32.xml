                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt-</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>The news from my John is excellent &#8212; + he is most enthusiastic about Red Cross + his part in that <unclear>Inabilution</unclear> &#8212; His appointment has been made, the Departmental Delegate to the Gironde. Which is the province where much of the American landing of troops + supplies takes place, at Bordeaux&#8212; so I am addressing my letters to him there, altho<sic>although</sic> he was still in Paris where he last wrote, a month ago &#8212; I am putting Care American Red Cross Bordeaux, France until I get further instructions, in which case I will send to you&#8212; &#8212;</p>
                
                <p>Has John written you of the neglectful leaving of his copy of "Pheidias"? He went off with the manuscript reposing in the table drawer of Hotel Bristol <hi rend="caps">N.Y.</hi> + thought of it only after some hours out. The pilot had not left the steamer, + he wrote a note to the Hotel, instructing them to send it to me, which the Pilot promised to mail &#8212; nothing has been heard of it &#8212; as soon as his first letter came, a month after his sailing date, I wrote
                
                    <pb facs="nei.j4a.5.31-32_0002"/>
                    
                    <fw type="curatorial">32</fw>
                
                immediately to the Hotel + asked them to telegraph me if the manuscript had <hi rend="underline">not</hi> been found &#8212; Yesterday, the wire arrived, saying, "manuscript not found here"&#8212; What do you advise my doing? The copy that you have is the only one, now, except the original which is here &#8212; would it be wise to have another copy typed? + do you advise putting the matter into the hands of a detective to try + recover the lost copy? I shall not do anything more until I hear from you, as John asked me to let you know at once. Your opinion + advice on the matter will be authority to me &#8212; It is too bad, but it only proves how he gives himself heart + soul to the subject interesting him, + often "Pheidias" had been finished, that subject was his work in France &#8212; &#8212; As I sit here under our pine-trees writing, the memory of those pleasant days last February, when you were here, <del/> with me, + I wish you could listen now to the sound of the tremendous surf which is booming on the Point. Come again some day, + bring Mrs Neihardt with you&#8212; Cordial greetings from Janette + Langley go with mine, to you &#8212;</p>
