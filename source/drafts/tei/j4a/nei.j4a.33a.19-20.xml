Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>In your papers there are 27 folders of bookreview columns from the <underline>Post-Dispatch</underline>. They are "Of Making Many Books" for 1930 through 1936. I do not know if this is a complete set of the column or not. There are 20 to 30 columns in each folder. We also have manuscripts of some of your reviews.</p>
Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Prewitt:
<p>I am delighted to know that you have so large a number of my <underline>Post-Dispatch</underline> columns in your collection. My secretary and I will be coming down the latter part of the last week in October to go over the clippings. I had forgotten that these columns were saved, and findings them has meant a very great difference in our preparing a volumn of essays. We had thought we would have to depend upon reading microfilms to collect all the articles, but the columns you have there should comprise nearly half the needed material.</p>
<p>Thank you greatly for your prompt reply.</p>
With all kind thoughts,
