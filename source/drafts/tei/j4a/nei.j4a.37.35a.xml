Dear Mr. Neihardt:
As you may know, Bower Aly reached his 70th birthday on February 20, 1973, and retires from the University of Oregon faculty at the end of the current term. 
We in the Department of Speech are holding a party in his honor on about March 20. 
At that time we wish to present him a book of letters from his friends and academic colleagues. I am sure he numbers you among those persons and if you wish a letter from you to be included to me. I will make certain that your letter is put in his hands on that occasion. 
Sincerely yours,
Carl W. Carmichael
Carl W. Carmichael, Head Department of Speech
