Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>I much enjoyed your appearance on the Cavett show, and much enjoyed the book <underline>Black Elk Speaks</underline>. I am in fact teaching that book this summer as part of a class in literature of the American Indian. It is a great book.</p>
<p>I wonder if you know the name of the actual flower or herb that Black Elk refers to, for example on page 201 of the Bison Book Edition. The passage is as follows:
"It had a root about as long as my elbow, and was a little thicker than my thumb. It was flowering in four colors, blue, white, red and yellow."</p>
<p>This is the four-rayed herb he had seen in his great vision. I wondered if there was such as actual herb on the plains, and would be glad for your assistance with regard to this question.</p>
Sincerely yours,
