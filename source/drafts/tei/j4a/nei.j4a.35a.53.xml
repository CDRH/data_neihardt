Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>I saw you on the Dick Cavett Show on Television on April 27,1971. I had an extremely pleasant feeling when I saw you. It does all of us a great joy to know your works are getting wider acclaim.</p>
<p>I am writing a little late because I wanted to wait tilll I went down the Guly Gorge on a rubber raft near the head waters of the Hudson River. The ride was about 4 hours for about a ten mile trip. In desending, I reminded myself of your book"The River And I". I can now say I have experienced some of your feelings. Someday I'll see the upper Missouri and duplicate your trip. Its great fun going down the rapids after the initial experience. I now can't  wait till next year to duplicate the tirp. I picked up "The River And I" off the shelf and thumbed over it. I'll be now comletly rereading it. There were many passages I enjoyed. Of the ones I read , I enjoyed the concluding paragraph, when a "friend asked me what I expected to find on the trip." "Some more of myself." I answered. After all, that is the Great Discovery.</p>
<p>Finding out something about yourself is a Great Discovery and that is why it was a great pleasure to be one of your students.</p>
<p>How is your autobiography coming along?</p>
Aufweidersehen from you
student,
Rudolf Kopecky
