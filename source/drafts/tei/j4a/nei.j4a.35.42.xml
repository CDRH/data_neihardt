Mr. John Neihardt 
5835 Vine Street
Lincoln, Nebraska 68505

Dear John:
<p>The enclosed xerox from Mrs. Nancy C. Prewitt is self explanatory. I hope I can have written permission from you to use, as well as copy, the John G. Neihardt papers. I shall probably not use the privilege tomorrow, but might find it a fascinating project when I get out from under the burdens of the Presidency.</p>
With all good wishes.
Sincerely,
<signed>Frank</signed>
Frank P. Piskor
President
