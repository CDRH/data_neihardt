Dear Mr. Neihardt,
<p>I have just finished reading "Black Elk Speaks" which filled me with inexplicable pain and sorrow for the people of the Indian Nations. I feel great pity for my own forefathers who had a part in the butchering and herdings of the people! How could the conquering (European) people have felt so compelled to come into a land which was at peace and harmony (except, perhaps, warring nations), and take it upon themselves to very nearly rub out an entire people? This is entirely beyong my comprehension as a human being. I so have one question: What can I do besides treat others as relatives? It's too late for feelings of guilt, and all that is in guilt by proxy in a way since I had nothing to do with the course of History. I wish I could change History (to relieve my guilt I suppose) but that is a selfish wish.</p>
<p>I saw you speak on the "Dick Cavett Show" recently, and recite the tales of the Indian wars, and I plan on reading your collected works. Also, I would consider it an honor if you would correspond with me from time to time.</p>
<p>Knowing you are a very busy man, and appreciating the fact that you've even read this letter, I remain thirsty for knowledge of the truths you hold.</p>
Sincerely 
Jane Van Camp
