Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>My sincere thanks come for your remembering me with a first copy of THE SPLENDID WAYFARING.</p>
<p>Ethel would have liked reading it with me, and <unclear>us</unclear> one would have been more appreciative of your writing.</p>
<p>Now that she is gone I shall cherish</p>
Page 27
<p>more than ever the delightful photograph I made of the two of you.</p>
<p>I shall call you one day this fall, and perhaps we can have a quiet talk.</p>
Gratefully yours,
Harold Clingerman
