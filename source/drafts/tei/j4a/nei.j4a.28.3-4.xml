<p>Dear Mr. Neihardt: </p>

<p>Plans for the Marker dedication are coming along in fine style I had hoped to be relieved of work on that project, but was informed last night that the Neihardt committee would have to take over responsibility for the hospitality bit following the ceremonies.</p>

<p>We are planning a get together in our local Park after the dedication. There will of course be many people there who will want to meet you and your family. This would be all but impossible out on hi-way 51. The Park, as you no doubt remember, is shaded and has a small cook house from which we shall dispense iced tea and cookies to all Bancroft visitors who care to come. In case of rain, Black Elk forbid! we have reserved the Legion building.</p>

<p>I hope you will be pleased with our progress at the study site. The Prayer Garden is doing fine and will be in apple pie order for the many who will visit it on August 1</p>

<p>Would you please write as soon as you receive this and let me know how many will be in your party, and what time you expect to arrive. I suppose it will be a two day trip for you, as it is such a long distance.</p>

<p>Please tell your daughters that they are welcome to make our home their headquarters during your day in Bancroft, our small town, as you know, is lacking in public facilities. I'm sure they would appreciate a place to relax and powder their noses and fix their hair

between public appearances. I have a lot of questions I want to ask you on that day. In fact, I have a list. Lets hope I dont lose it!</p>

<p>Right now there is this question.</p>

<p>Our committee is planning to buy a talking machine for the Prayer Garden. You know the kind I mean, put in a dime, and out comes a voice, (in this case Neihardts) giving an explanation of the why's and wherefors of the Garden. The company I am contacting is the one that designed the machine for the Willa Cather Memorial and also for the Eisenhower Museum.</p>

<p>We would like to have you make a tape recordind while you are here next Sunday. I have two recorders asked for, two so that if one doesnt do the job well, the other one should. Simultaneous recording of course. Perhaps you would like to add a few words to your explanation, either at the begining <del/> or at the end. That is why I am writing now to give you time to think about it.</p>

<p>I am sure that this taped message can be transfered to the machine when and if we get the money to buy one.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you pass along this letter to Alice, and Enid and Hilda.</p>
