Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>Just a quick note to say how much I enjoyed the Dick Cavette show April 27. It was like being there with you again. Many of my students saw it and learned from it also. I was happy to see my bracelet too!</p>
<p>I got married yesterday! We were married in Washington U.'s chapel. My new wife is named Gail. She + I both worked at the Chicago Indian Center, which is where we met. The maid of honor was the youth worker from the Center, and two of the quests were Sioux.</p>
<p>My parents say the TV special and enjoyed it. It was really a great show.</p>
<p>Regards to the Youngs. I hope you are all well and at least half as happy as I am right now.</p>
Love, 
Jim Tibensky
