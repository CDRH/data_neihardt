Dear John_
<p>Matt and I were very disappointed to learn that the date of your Dick Cavett show was changed from the 21st to the 27th. For then we would be on the road heading North toward Maine and finding a place to stop with sufficient TV Channel has chancy - But the 27th found us in Northern North Carolina - we searched the TV live up in their local paper _ but no mention of the Dick Cavett Show. Quite discouraged we went to bed - but Matt just wouldn't give up and continued turning the dial <underline>in hopes</underline>. I fell asleep - only to be <unclear>an a hened</unclear> by Matt's Show - "Here in John!" So we did see your Dick Cavett Show - the whole hour</p>

<p>and a half and loved it! Though we resulted all those commercial that interrupted you. We thought that you looked and sounded great.</p>
<p>We are now in another motel in Virginia and havent the slightest interest in what is and TV tonight. We are still glowing over last night.</p>
<p>By Saturday we will be back at our lovely little lake and mountains. We expect to find patches of snow and ice on the lake - as last year - and we will be in time for SPring once again.</p>
Affectionate greetings
Matt and Margaret

<p>I do better on 
the typewriter</p>
