Dear Dr.Neihardt;
<p>I am writing to ask you if, in the month of September, you may be able to come to the Nebraska State Historical Society and speak to a small group of ladies who are training for their volunteer duties here as guides.On September the 15th at 9:30,there will be ten ladies coming to the Society to learn about the early Indians in this area and we would be most indebted to you if you might be able to spend an hour here telling you interesting accounts on this subject. All Wednesdays in September will be spent in preparation for the fall school term.If there is another Wednesday in Spetember that would be more suitable for you,please indicate and we would be willing to make adjustments to accommodate you as we would be most anxious to have you.</p>
Sincerely,
Mrs. Elsie Sailors
