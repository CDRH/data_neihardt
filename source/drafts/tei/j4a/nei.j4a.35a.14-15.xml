Dear Mr. Neihardt,
<p>Tonight you brought a lump to my throat. Your words were so simple - yet so great, aside so beautiful. "Men are just mean, we are all the same, we should respect each others wisdom, each others cultures."</p>
<p>Indeed if all mankind lived by these words, the world would be a beautiful place in which to live.</p>
<p>Thank you for being on the Dick Cavett Show - and you have reminded me to try to live better tomorrow than I did today.</p>
Sincerely,
Mrs. Connie Ward
