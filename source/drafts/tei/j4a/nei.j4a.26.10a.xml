                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Your letter was most welcome, and I'm glad to hear about the talk at the Presbyterian Student center. The things you tell me are the most useful to know, and you will never sound boastful to me. The reaction of the group is always important, and I'm glad to have the report of the quiet, interested conversation after the speech. The impression you make on students or any audiences--should not surprise anyone; think of what is behind it all.</p>
                
                <p>When I last wrote I had not yet read the new set of letters nor seen the snapshots in the b<del>i</del><add>o</add>x. The pictures are excellent, and I want to use some of them if possible. Also, many letters as I have read, every new group opens up new areas. You have certainly had an amazing life. Now I have some new questions, specially about the <hi rend="caps">YMCA</hi> camp Duncan. <unclear><del>W</del><add>H</add></unclear>ow did you happen to go there? What were the pageants you put on? Did you write them? That's a whole project I hadn't heard of before.</p>
                
                <p><del>S</del><add>A</add>lso I'm having trouble pinning down the months on the Sioux City paper. It must have been the fall of 1907, or the <del>pr</del><add>sp</add>ring of 1908, but if you remember anything specific let me know. For instance, you were in Spearfish canyon that summer (1907), back in <add>September in</add> Bancroft, then you had mentioned to Davis planning to camp out in the wilderness, and you came back to Bancroft "from the north" early in December, according to the <hi rend="underline">Blade</hi>. In February, 1908, your sister Lulu was married, and you were at the wedding. The same month you were active in the Bancroft Athletic Association, and the problem in<sic>is</sic>, when did you have time to work in Sioux City? Did you give up that job to make the river trip? If I can get the time pinned down I'm fairly sure I can get the papers. It couldn't have been <hi rend="underline">after</hi> the river trip because there wasn't time.</p>
                
                <p>I have just read the Harriet Monroe letters. Most of her answers were not there unless they were typed; she didn't keep copies of her hand-written letters. Your last one <add><del>1</del>1928</add> was a gesture of peace about her article "Why Not Laugh?" Did she ever answer that? Your letter about Ezra Pound was there, and it's a good discussion of <hi rend="underline">vers libre</hi>. From these letters it sounds to me as if our Harriet's real trouble with you was that she admired you very much all the time down underneath. She sounds to me like a person who enjoyed fighting with people, and I don't think she understood at all that you <hi rend="underline">didn't</hi> like to fight. You must have been terribly frustrating for her.</p>
                
                <p>Mrs. Winkleman sent me a reprodu<del>v</del><add>c</add>tion of "The Harpist" from the Wayne paper. She says it will behard<sic>be hard</sic> to locate "The Tentiad," which is not in any of the issues the library has. I think I will try to get to Wayne next summer, and perhaps I can turn up a copy of the paper there. Mrs. Winkelmen is sending me also a commencement poem that may be yours. It isn't signed, but it was written by "a local poet" forthe<sic>for the</sic> high school commencement. These versus are not for the dissertation, but they are interesting in showing how your ideas weee<sic>were</sic> developing.</p>
                
                <p>I want to ask you about the Agamemnon translation too. In the library the folders that hold it are labeled "<hi rend="underline">portions</hi>" of theAgamemnon<sic>the Agamemnon</sic>. I want to have it photostated next summer, and I wondered whether the complete manuscript is in the library. I'd like to make a transcript and check it over with you if you're willing, because someday somebody ought to produce it.</p>
                
                <p>The section of the study I'm working on is your years as critic. It is certainly worth a book in itself. It's like everything else you did--a big plan and care on details, or in your words, an epic with lyrical detail. That's your idea of poetry too, isn't it--"a goading purpose and a creeping pace"? Your life is in wide circles--but you know that.</p>
                
                <p>Please give our love to everyone. I hope all the colds and twisted ankles are well in the past. Pat Yo-yo some love for me, as Stewart used to say.</p>
                
                <note type="authorial">Side note/ The Traumerei is beautiful. Before the biography we must get a good picture of the lyrical ashtray. Has it a name?</note>
