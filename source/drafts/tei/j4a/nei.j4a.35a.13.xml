Dear Dr. Neihardt,
<p>What a thrill is was for me to see you again after so many years. Your appearance on the Dick Cavett Show was a sincere pleasure.</p>
<p>I attended the University of Missouri form 1954-1958. The absolute highlight of my entire college career was the semester (spring '58) I took your course, "Epoch America." I treasure your inscription in my copy of <underline>Cycle of the West</underline>.</p>
<p>For many years I taught fifth grade. I never missed a year of reading some of your work to my students.</p>
<p>God bless you.</p>
Most sincerely,
NaOma Levy
