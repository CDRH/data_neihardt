Dear Mr. Neihardt-
<p>It is with great pleasure that I write to you and thank you from my soul for having read. Your book "Black Elk Speaks." Three years ago while in Montana I saw this book of yours at the Browning Indiana Museum and it seemed to "glow" so I bought it and read it on my way back to California. I know almost immediately why the book beckoned after the first three pages and I thnak God for having been exposed to the soul of the American Indian as never before in my life.</p>

<p>Over the past few years I've often wondered about you adn was rewarded which I heard you on the Dick Cavett T.V. show the other night.</p>
<p>Your spiritual awareness and <unclear>atonement</unclear> is like a beautiful beacon light in a darkened world. May it long shine into the lives of many.</p>
<p>You spoke on "The death of Crazy Horse". Is this in print and if so where could I obtain a copy?</p>
<p>May the Great Spirit of the Universe continue to bless and inspire you in this life and the life ahead.</p>
God love you,
Betty Clair
