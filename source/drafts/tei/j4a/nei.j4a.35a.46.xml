MEMORANDUM 4/30/71
To: John G. Neihardt
From: George W. Linden
Subject: hello

Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>I re-read <underline>Black Elk Speaks</underline> yesterday and I want to tell you what a fine experience it was. It is a good and beautiful book. I also saw your image on the Cavett show and it was good to know your mind and voice are as vigorous as ever. The poet that your influence is on the rise again is a good argument for your thesis of the persistance of the spirit.</p>
<p>As you probably buns, I am now a professor (philosophy) and family man. My mother said she had a visit with you several years ago. I still am afflicted with writing poetry and turn my hand to it when I have the chance. the purpose of this letter was simply to wish you well. I do so.</p>
Yours,
Bill Linden
