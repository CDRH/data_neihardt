                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Some months past I did a study on the development of the epic concept in American literature, and in the course of my research I came to know your poetry. Since then I have undertaken an evaluation of your writings as a separate endeavor. My reading has been completed, but I am aware of several questions concerning it which to me would seem to require your statement, if I may so infringe upon your good nature. I am most concerned that I make no pronouncements which are not according to your original intention, for I have become alarmed that none of the students with whom I share this study seem to be familiar with your work. I hesitate to misrepresent a poet who has said those things which you have found significant. A few weeks ago I took exception to a list of "important books in Enlgish from 1901-1950" published by the Grolier Club because, among others, your epic cycle was not included. Mr. Vincent Starrett was generous enough to restate my letter in his column in The Chicago Tribune, and as a result the graduates with whom I am at present working became interested in my investigation of your writings. May I, then, ask you the following questions?</p>
                
                <p>Am I justified in believing that you are a conscious descendent of Whitman and of Emerson? I do not, of course, mean a literal reflection, but rather a traditional one.</p>
                
                <p>Has anyone done a satisfactory biographical presentation of your life and literary production? I have been unable to find anything of value, even at Newberry Library.</p>
                
                <p>Have you been a student of old Irish literature? I have been mightily interested in this field and have wondered that your characters at times speak with that same richness that the pre-ninth century Celts reveal.</p>
                
                <p>I think that I am correctly aware of the Homeric elements in your poetry, but I am not able to trace the epic simile. Wherein am I failing to read as I should?</p>
                
                <p>Mr. Neihardt, if you are able to spare the time to advise me concerning these things, I shall be most appreciative, indeed. In closing may I say that I have introduced your poetry into my classes at The Chicago Latin School for Boys, and have seen the most ardent response to poetry that I have yet enjoyed. For that alone I am in your debt.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Very sincerely,</salute>
