Gentlemen:
<p>On the Dick Cavett show Tuesday night, April27 Dr Neihardt appeared and told of his book written many eyars ago entitled Black Elk Speaks. I have hunted for this title and finally found it in Standard Catalog published by Wilson - th 1947 volume. The reference there was to a short story in a volume by Amy Hogeboam entitled Boy's book of the "est published in 1946 by your compay/ -s this publication available or do you have another title that contains this story? Our eighth grade students have become interested in any Indian story that deals with the early west as well as those of a more recent period.</p>
<p>I am enclosing a self addressed envelope.</p>
Thanking you for your information,
