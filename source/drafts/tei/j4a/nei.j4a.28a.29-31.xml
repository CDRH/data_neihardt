<p>Dear John: &#8212; How good to hear from you and to
learn of your safe arrival. And my, how you are
in demand &#8212; New York, Ithaca, The <unclear/>
Poetry Society. I think that is wonderful.
Perhaps then touches with <unclear/> explain you.
As Antaeus touched the earth &amp; drew from it reviving
strength, so perhaps all these contacts buoy
you up.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you of the impression you made here.
At the opening of my first class after you recited, I got
all sorts of questions about you. They were clearly
greatly interested. Prof. Golden told me too, how much
his students appreciated you, &amp; how pleased he
was that you could take them for a period just
as if you had been teaching them right along, &amp; give
then exactly what they needed.</p>

<p>I heard any number of favorable comments on your
public lecture. My assistant, Russell Moran,
made one of the most interesting observations. He
noted that late in my class &amp; in the
public lecture, the people were leaning back in
their seats at the start, but then as you
talked they leaned forward.</p>

<p><unclear>Reverend</unclear> Christie said that he believed the
part of Sitting Bull dealing with the behavior of
his horse is the first thing of its kind in English
literature: Then he said something else the like of
which I have never heard before. He is allergic to horses.
They bring on a sort of asthma. As you recited, he
felt a recurrence of his asthma. How's that for
reality!</p>

<p>Nita &amp; I were so glad to have you in the
house as our guest. And you always do so much
for my spirit. How grateful I am for that 
day spent on my manuscript. I wrote to Clarkson
Potter, &amp; he asked me to read the mss to him.
Maybe he won't take it, but when it has such
strong approval from you, I should feel like
trying some more.</p>

<p>If you should go to New York, or some other
eastern point, be sure to stop with us on
your return. As used to be said in olden
times to a dear friend, the latch string is
always out for you</p>
