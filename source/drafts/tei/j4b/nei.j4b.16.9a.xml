Dearest Daddy and Mama:
<p>I received a telegram from Albert telling me he is leaving Tuesday morning. Even though I've been waiting for the news, it stuns me. I am going to call him today. In fact, I just now went out to call him, then remembered it's only 5:30 out there.</p>
<p>His operation was evidently an unusually successful one, and because he was a "cooperative patient", an especially fine surgeon used him to demonstrate operating technique to another doctor. He was kept in the hospital a full week, even though he felt well enough before that. Several other fellows operated at the same time had complications.</p>
<p>I had another fine letter from Enid. I'm so glad she's my sister!</p>
<p>I love you very much; otherwise I'd not write you at all this morning. But I can't write in detail, however, and I know you will understand. I am collecting myself for that telephone call.</p>
Much love ever,
Hilda
<p>Don't worry about me, for I'm very well prepared for this. We both are. It's just that I can't write about other things now.</p>
