Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>Your dear, happy letters make me rejoice for and with you - I am not trying to answer them adequately to day, as I am minus glasses, and am able to do this writing only because Daddy is taking an after dinner nap and I am using his glasses - which make me weep, but - help me to see! I will write as soon as I have my new glasses, which will be Sunday P.M. or Monday A.M. Your house <underline>is</underline> perfectly beautiful - and we are so thrilled over it! We wish we could exchange this one for one somewhat like yours and in the vicinity of St. Louis. Then we could all be together, which is after all what we <underline>most</underline> desire.</p>
<p>Daddy has a couple of small <unclear/> boils and a slight "<unclear>fluy</unclear>" condition, so I am Keeping him in bed as much as possible to get him in good shape for</p>

<p>his near trip. The Men are going South East, clear to Florida - but not in the direction of Fort Worth <underline>this</underline> time.</p>
<p>Sig is doing <underline>so</underline> well. He has two more added to this trip, making it very well filled up with dates.</p>
<p>Will write again soon. Have not written to Hilda and Alice this week on account of my eyes - Must stop now as these glasses strain my eyes terribly.</p>
Oceans of love and many Kissees form your "<sic>ownly</sic>"
Mom - Mother.
