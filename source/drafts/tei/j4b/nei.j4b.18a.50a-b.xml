Sunday morning
Dearest Mama and Daddy:
<p>News from you has been so very scarce lately - why? I hope you are well, at least.</p>
<p>One day flies by after another; time surely passes too quickly. I wish we could see you once in awhile. Albert's making the trip is impossible because he could get no time off - it has nothing to do with expenses.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful time with Millie the other day. She took me to lunch at the Castilla.</p>
<p>Last Sunday Albert adn I swam all day and got a fine sunburn. Albert suffered quite a bit, although he was not blistered. I hope we go again soon before we lose our tan.</p>
<p>This evening we are going to visit</p>
2
<p>The Roger Sibson's. Roger is a young man in Alberts department. They are both very nice, and I'm glad we're going.</p>
<p>I have been practising every day - there <underline>is</underline> no news.</p>
<p>Did you by any chance find that white card showing I was registered with the U.S. Note Dept.? You will remember I had it when in Branson, now I need to return it and cannot find it.</p>
<p>Albert is busy on our Book. Sig is practising at Amama's. Maxie is cleaning in the kitchen.</p>
<p>By the way, we are finally getting our new wallpaper!</p>
<p>Please write soon - I missing hearing from you.</p>
Endless love to all three,
Hilda 
<p>What about our wedding pictures?</p>
