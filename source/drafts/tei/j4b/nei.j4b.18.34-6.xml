Hilda Darling:
<p>So grateful for your coming this weekend. We hope this cold spell may be gone by then. I am very much better and it is entirely safe for Daddy to go with you Sunday to St Louis, then on to Boonville. There will be no heavy chores to do and I <underline>want</underline> to remain here, quiet and <underline>at home</underline>. The babies play so interestedly together now - the days pass so quickly for them - Joanie said yesterday "Oh Nannie the days are <underline>so</underline> short!" when it ws time to get ready for bed!</p>

<p>Daddy will do all the lifting - then we do not have to wash again till he returns from Boonville. Daddy will have the coal all up too. - We have a new load of wonderful, dry wood too.</p>
<p>It will be splendid to see you, Albert and Alice, and bring all the blankets etc you can, because we do not wnat our hardy pioneer to suffer from cold!</p>
<p>That sweater must be gorgeous! Our Radio is marvelous once more. Short Wave is a Godsend - I hope you will be able to hear Kaltenbach when you are here - his talks are so honest and illuminating too.</p>
Auf Wiederschen mein Liebling!
