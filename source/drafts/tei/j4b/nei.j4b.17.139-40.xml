Dear Hiddy &amp; Alice:
<p> Just received an enthusiastic letter from Latham about <underline>Jed Smith</underline>. Here is a paragraph.</p>
<p>"The MS has now been read by our advisers, and also by myself &amp; by others here, and I send you our hearty congratulations. What a satisfaction it must be to have completed this splendid Cycle begun so many years ago, and to complete it so well! <underline>Jed Smith</underline> is, I think, a completely <strike/> satisfying pieve of work, probably your best work to date. It has passages of great beauty and power. There is, as I see it, no let down in quality from first to last."</p>
<p>Lloyd Mitchell of Hollywood writes hopefully about engagements for fall &amp; winter</p>

<p>things will work out finely, I know.</p>
<p>Sig is visiting here, until tomorrow.</p>
Endless love to both of you
Dad
