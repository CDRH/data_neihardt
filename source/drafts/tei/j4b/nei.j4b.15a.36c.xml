Dear Dad &amp; Mom-
<p>We have all enjoyed the postcards received from you along the way. It all sounds fine &amp; dandy.</p>
<p>I wrote Hilda, telling her of your Bison address (gen'l delivery) up to &amp; incl. the 17.</p>
<p>There is no news as yet. Surely something will happen soon, through the mail.</p>
<p>I hope you will not hurry back home needlessly; for it is now getting into hottest part of summer I believe.</p>
<p>I am grateful for this spell of nothing in particular to do. In about a week I must start writing a number of important letters, spurring up various institutions that need it.</p>
<p>The practice goes a bit better now. Seems that my woozy right hand improves more as time goes by.</p>
Always lots of love,
Sig.
