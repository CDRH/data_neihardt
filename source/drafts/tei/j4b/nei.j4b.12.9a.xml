Dearest Mama,
I got to the store earlier this morning than usual, & have been listening to the new & heavenly records of the Victor Record Co., & played by the marvelous newly developed electric record played. 
When one is blue, he can listen to these heartbreaking & gorgeous recordings - & then realize strongly that regardless of the suffering a person goes thru there is this one thing that always makes it seem worthwhile! 
Oh God! How I pray that I can soon send you one of these record playing attachments which hooks onto your radio - so you may hear with radio clearness the exquisite beauty that is in these new records, 
(over) 

everytime Max & I listen to these things - I say to her there is no - one in this World who loves the true beauty any more than you, & <del>that</del> who deserves to have this pleasure, I have another sale on for today it seems evident.
Must close for now, & always I love you & think of you plenty every day! 
Please take care of yourself! 
Endless love,
Sig. 
P.S. 
Can't play for two wks yet! Think how I have suffered for the need of my hands! S.N.
