Dearest Enid:
<p>Your sweet letter is at hand and I want to write at once to tell you that the plan for any of <unclear/> to come up to St Louis has been entirely discarded - We <underline>cannot</underline> afford it.</p>
<p>So many thank dear for all your and Ollies' goodness.</p>
<p>I had a fear Alic might not get off at the right place - things look so different at night.</p>
<p>I'll write more later - are very busy with a number of things -</p>

Mom
<p>Our bestest to Ollie too-</p>
<p>P.S. Will you all celebrate Xmas together at your home? I'd love to think of that being so!</p>
