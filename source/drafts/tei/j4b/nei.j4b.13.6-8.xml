JOHN A. REED 
MANAGING EDITOR 
THE WICHITA EAGLE 
WICHITA, KANSAS

Wichita, Kas., Tues. a. m. 
Dear Ollie:
I saw managing Editor Reed of the Eagle. he gave me his card, which I enclose, and said: "Tell your friend to write me a letter telling all about himself". I gave as your reason for being willing to leave the P-D that your wife can't stand the St. Louis climate. He said, "I don't blame her!" 
This is a sweet little city and apparently prosperous because of the oil. So clean! 
I'm in a hurry to start for Pueblo. Everyone here sends affectionate thoughts. 
Dad 
Please write Reed soon. he leaves the first week in August on vacation. 
Reed knows German well. (Is the name correctly spelled? It's the Sunday man. I've met him.)
