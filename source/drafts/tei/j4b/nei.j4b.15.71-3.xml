Dear Enat and Oddie:
<p>It's been several weeks since I rec'd your good letters, and I suppose my silence hardly seems an indication of the deep affection I always feel for you. Until four days ago I couldn't go ahead with Jed, but suddenly I broke loose, for no reason that I know about, and in 4 days I've done 32 lines, with many more in prospect. So I'm happy now, and can write letters.</p>
<p>You should see the place now - beautiful! I've been cleaning up all around, making the yard spick and span for Nanny's return. While I was under the cloud, I got going on a rock crystal ring - and it's a darb - doesn't look as though somebody made it himself. Gold lived, gold ring around flaming fire opal in top. The crystal so beautiful &amp; throws light through the gem. You're in line soon, old lady Enat!</p>

<p>I'm getting good, and will be better able to do a really fine thing. How the amethyst would glow ofset in crystal! I'm dreaming about it. And if I can only get some jadeite &amp; a few rough rubies I'll do a ring as fine as that Ghengis Khan wore! No kidding. I make my diamond tools &amp; polishing devices as needed. There <underline>are</underline> no tools available for my special purposes.</p>
<p>I'm nuts about Jed, seeing, as I do, where the whole thing is driving to! I emptied myself in the "Messiah", and now I'm full again with very different stuff. It sems now I can say all I feel in this poem, all I'll ever want to say. But then - there's "A Catalog of Beautiful Things" waiting for another filling.</p>
Love to you both.
<p>yes, old Enat, I thought of three years ago where you and I started the page. Good days to remember, because of you, Old Girl and Pal!</p>
