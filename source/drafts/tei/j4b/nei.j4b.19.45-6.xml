Dearest Children:
<p>The marvelous news, Sigurd, of your going to Brazil or elsewhere makes me so proud of you. I Know that you have done fine work and that you will <hi rend="underline"> always</hi> be a valuable man to whatever concern you are working for. I Know that applying yourself to your music has made you a <hi rend="underline"> superior</hi> workman, as you are now proving. Strange how very much you are like <hi rend="underline"> my dear</hi> father, who excelled in business, although a musician at heart! Brazil is going to be a very fine part of the World to live in after the War. So I am wondering if you will plan to have your family follow you there and locate in that country - or not?</p>

<p>Maxie you might do well to study Spanish, when you have time at home, and you certainly can Know that applying yourself to your home, your meals and your children is the very wisest thing you can possibly do at the present time. I do not regret the years I spent that way I have <hi rend="underline"> earned</hi> the right to feel free to go out and earn some money of my own now, and far from being too hard, I am enjoying it. I can Keep my self respect, and see Dad through a tight place, till something <hi rend="underline"> suitable</hi> for him works out.</p>
Loads of Love to you all
four from your devoted
Mom - Nanny.
