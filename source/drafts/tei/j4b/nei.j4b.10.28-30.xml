<salute>Dear Hiddy:</salute>
</opener>

<p>Mama sent on your letter about the fix you have been in, and I'm more soryr than I can say, I can't see how it happened, unless my first letter containing money and map reach you - or maybe it was the second. 
Anyway, I don't want it ot happen again! Surely there is no need of it, 
I've had a very fine trip. Will read here tonight &amp; catch the 5:50 tain for Minneapolis tomorrow morning, then take the 9:20 train from there for Grinnell. Will reach home Thursday.

I went into that place in Minneapolis &amp; saw the <unclear/> with holster that was advertised. It is practically new - no sign of wear anywhere inside or outside. I wanted it a lot, but of course it would be foolish to buy it. 
The weather has been five up here - even at Moorhead what is as far worth as Duluth. I arrived for the January thaw. They have had 30 below at Moorhead 25 at Minneapolis
Endless love, Hiddy, 
Dad,
Comradely greetings to Elanita!

I am really happy about much, and you are a large part of the muchness! 
Had an ambrosial evening with Dr. Richard Scammon, Dean of Medical Sciences at U. of Minnesota. he is a very distinguished man. You know, he is my old "Dick"- one of my best boyhood chums, We were inseparable as she ages of 9 &amp; 10. We got together in five shops. He &amp; his son &amp; their University crowd are flaming Reds. The song is leader of the Farmen Labor Party in Minnesota, &amp; he is only 18! the kid is 5ft. 5 1/2 in tall &amp; weighs 260 lbs, also, he has a brain big enough for a such a body. 
I feel he will get killed early in teh inevitable row. But he will be heard from How they, &amp; another Prof., did endorse my prophetic guesses.

<p>P.S. 
10:30 P.M. same day! 
Am through here. Swede audience, or at least very largely swede. They fell for it as usual, &amp; called me from behind the curtain when I had really quit. They are not so quoteably civilized here as in Moorehead - Fargo, but they are quite all right. 
Hiddy, I've just read yoiur lette rover two glasses of beer after the show. It's a great letter, Old Kid! I needn't tell you how dear you are to me &amp; how highly I appraise you.
Hiddy, it's a shame you had to be chagrined for each of money! It mustnt be. </p>
