Dear Miss Piper: 
I am writing you to tell you how much I enjoyed my share of that lovely Andy you sent as. It was very nice of you to send it to us. It is awfully nice of you to remember us every xmas. It has been nice down here. It was just like Spring when Xmas was here (over)

Is it cold up there in Hastings Nebr. I bet it wasn't like Springtime Xmas day up there. Was it? 
I have a big collection of foreign stamps. My Grandma in Palo Alto California sent them to me. I'm interested in Collecting them - Thanking you again for the lovely candy. 
Yours affectionately,
Enid Neihardt
