Dear Enot:
No - of course it wasn't your fault. I should have told you that the ring would not stand extreme changes of temperature now, but forgot to do so. Your explanation is correct. The man who sold me the ivory warmed me about the cold. 
But I can easily fix the ring as good or better than new. Please send it to me. The cement I have is <del/> stranger than the ivory itself, and I'd like to add an inner band. 
Love to both 
Dad
