Precious Alice:
<p>It was heartening to read your latest, and it certainly seems a bully opportunity. What fun it will be, too, in addition to being Your chosen work! We all have perfect faith in you and know you'll go on and on.</p>
<p>I've just heard of a possibility that the University of Nebraska may offer me a professorhip with an independent chair. Mama &amp; I would love this, and if I were there, I'd no doubt be able to get Ollie into one of the Lincoln papers. I'll tell more than there's more to tell; but it does seem a possiblity.</p>
<p>Endless love to you and affectionate thoughts for your two girl pals.</p>
Dad.
<p>Soon I should get that check, and then I'll be able to help you. Mama hasn't yet seen your letter.</p>
