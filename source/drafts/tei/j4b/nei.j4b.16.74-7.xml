Enid Darling-
<p>I can see the brick wall and its noses already! That is a swell plan! We have burned at least 8 tons of coal - we had 10 and have over 2 left, may be more. <underline>What</underline> a Winter - but we should have a good Spring and lots of fruit.</p>
<p>The Men are gone and we do miss them terribly.</p>
<p>Hilda says she so wants to have Alice soon - anyway it will all work out satisfactorily_</p>
<p>Wish <underline>I could</underline> help! How I'd love to keep house for them! -</p>
<p>Max and I will work on</p>

<p>Elaines' Birthday present tonight after the Wubs are asleep. We are putting a new head on an old doll and making new clothes for it! Lots of fun! 'Laine thinks Betty (the doll) has gone to the Hospital and will come back on her birthday!! Max has been cutting old things into strips and crocheting a "throw" for the Divan - it is swell! You two should be able to do things of the homy sort together, you'd enjoy each other.</p>
<p>Excuse this rushy note -</p>
Loads of love as always
Mama.
