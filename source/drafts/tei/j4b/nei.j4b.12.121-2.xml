Darling Husband

Virginia is so wise! She knows when to be serious and when to play! 
I hope she will be with our children when their babies come, who knows?! 
I am getting strong rapidly and will do all in my power to get well fast Darling but i cna only re-peat things by trying too hard. Hilda tells me that the Dr in Springfield told her I could not expect to go back to work for six months and that she is here to see that I don't. So that settles my sculpting any this year.

clay down from Dr Corm's model was put hte raw material down in the clay bin - So that is that. I want to make each of the girls a beautiful quilt as soon as I can use my hands and brain properly. I have great dif=ficulty in controlling my hands us yet but I can feed myself - and Oh how good that seems! Darling I think you are wonderful to get out such a re markable page every week and I do hope you will not have to give up hav ing a good time of some sort this sum mer - you should. My glasses are a complete mis fit - but I know all they need is an expert - so I'll get along till I can go to your man in St Louis. John dear I wish I could write you a decent letter but just holding the pen is an effort that makes me feel so queer. 
Dearest send us rain Every thing is going to the God of destruction I'm so happy over Sigurd, and now if Enid is lucky Our problems will be half solved won't they? - Loads of love to my great good Man from Mona.
