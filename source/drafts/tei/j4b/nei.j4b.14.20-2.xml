Dear Ollie and Enot:
I'm happy about the fine talk with Bovard, and his warm - hearted praise of your features - all of which is true. He could, and would, help in getting a job with some other paper. 
Everything up there has become - dim and far away. When I think of it at all - which is seldom - I'm mildly amused. So much phony importance! Such quantities of nothing at all! 
You'll be seeing the girls, perhaps, before this reaches you; for the week has passed like an hour, and they'll leave in the morning. I've flirted with the idea of driving them back so that I might get an eyeful of you two. But I'll see you Nov. 26th, if not sooner. The National Council of Teachers of English will have its annual convention then at the Jefferson.

Strong tides have been flowing through me night and day, and I seem to be living all through me now. It's rather more than mere physical exercise that does it. 
Bovard asked me if I thought I might be able to interest a publisher in those articles he showed me x
I'll try, of course. 
I do want to pay the god's ransom, as that was the plan. 
Endless love to you both. 
Dad
