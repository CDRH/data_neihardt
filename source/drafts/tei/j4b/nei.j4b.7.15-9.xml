My Dear girl-
Such beautiful stationary should make a better correspond of me, well-we'll see, 
By the above date you are back at the old grind after a happy time at home, I wonder about Each member of your family so much. Know of course there are no little boys there and that the years pile up as fast on your father and mother as they do on me, - when the cal-endar announced my 69th-birthday-I was vulgarly speaking "flabbergasted."-

I think it is really a pity one can't wear out alike all over, my spirt is just as sprightly as when you need to live with me - but oh! mercy my old knees rebel frightfully. -you no doubt have wondered if I am here or some where else.- Well I'm here much to the disgust of my whole family - but I just got up on my hind legs and <del>and</del> said I would not be let out on the shares this winter - It just seemed to me I was packing and unpacking all teh time and I get so homesick - I can't live the lives as the children live them 
<unclear/> so.
