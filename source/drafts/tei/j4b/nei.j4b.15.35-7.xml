Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>So I'll be seeing you very shortly - and I can't tell you how eagerly I am looking forward to this trip. I want to be with the girls at nights and whit you, Enid while Ollie is away, (and the girls are at the office and in school)for the most of my stay in St Louis - besides I feel sure I can visit with you both, staying at least one or two nights, all depends once more on Daddy and what <underline>he</underline> does. He reads in Boonville on the 10th and we get to St. Louis on the 11th. Then Daddy and I will stay with you till the next day when Sig and Dad will start for Indiana. Sig could spend the night with the girls and come after Daddy the next day at your home. Then I could go</p>

<p>in to the Girls' the evening of the 12th, and remain there. I need to be with my baby - for after all, that is what Alice will always be - and I have felt almost guilty because circumstances have made it necessay for me to leave her. Foolish? Yes maybe - but nevertheless true.</p>
<p><underline>Please Tell Hilda</underline> for me, that unless unforseen things happen, Sig will be at here place on the 11th to spend the night - and I will be there on the 12th in plenty of time for supper. Daddy may have his dental work done after Culver Ind. by returning to St Louis but he may also just decide to leave for home and Jed Smith, which he has lead to abandon because of there trips. You know how that goes with him - dear Daddy!</p>
<p>Auf Wiederschen then to my Enid girlie and her best of Mau! Loving you too much for words -</p>
Your own old Mama. Mother
