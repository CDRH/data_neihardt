Dearest Kids:
<p>It's always so nice to get your letters you sound so happy and progressive. I do hope Sig's being there hasn't bothered you too much. Funny it had to happen right during Ollies vacation, just when you wanted to be together most. Of course I realize Sig hasn't been there all day lately, but he has been there just about the same time Ollie has. You have my deepest thanks and appreciation.</p>
<p>It's hot here now and won't be long until we are sleeping out on the porch. (I can't type today for some reason).</p>
<p>I can't plan to come even on a visit until after the folks return on this trip which will be around July 16. Naturally I wouldn't feel I could come for at least a week after that. That will make over two months since I have seen Sig. It frightens me sometimes. Still I feel that it is our first good chance and I do not wish to make any move until I am sure of x Sig's work.</p>
<p>Dad is waiting for me to finish this so I'll hurry. Wish you could see the wubs. Decoration day Marie and Paul came down bringing their fat sweet baby boy. I had a swell time with them. The baby is a darling, and so good.</p>
<p>I'd love it if you could find time to dash off a note to me when you have time. I always read your letters to the folks when you write them though and that's swell too.</p>
<p>Glad Ollie is home at a decent hour in the morning. It makes a lot of difference when one doesn't have to dash off to work so early. Fine for summer too.</p>
<p>My love to you and Ollie, tell Sig I will write tomorrow for there was nothing of importance to write about today and I did not hear from him so I thought he would not mind if I waited.</p>
Love to all, from Max and wubs.
