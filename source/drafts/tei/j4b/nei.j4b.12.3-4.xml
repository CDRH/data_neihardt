Tues. Evening 
Dearest Girl:
Supper just finished. Rec'd your good letter an hour ago. 
I wonder if I seem not ot be writing often enough. If so, you're in my round pretty often through the day, & I often wish you were here, my job requires a surprising amount of jumping around and fussing with details. It worries me, but it's not an unhappy weariness at all, I like it. I'm sure you'll liek the second logo better. I think ti is pretty good, and the third will be so good, I believe I have stocks of stuff all ready, could run two pages easily, wish I had two pages every week, may have them later on, of pubs, offer moe advertising. 
I will send you $25 this next week and, $20 regularly thereafter. If you can accumulate for something later 
No, I dont' go on mediums either Don't want to plan on leaving Branson until I see a good reason.

Golly, I wish the mediums prophecy were true! I do believe we'll be made to go to California sooner or later. They've all said that, & I feel it. I'm not so sure about prizes!!
