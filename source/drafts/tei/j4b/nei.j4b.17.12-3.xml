Dear Enot and Oddie:
<p>Hurrah for the good news! But I warn you, it's Nanny and Gaki are going to spoil it. Dog on! Gaki wants to hold that Wub &amp; pet it! Be careful and don't teeter the basket.</p>
<p>The kids were here &amp; are goine - zip! Happy visit. Last night I couldn't get to sleep, so I came downstairs for a bite to stay my nearly empty belly. Mama was sawing wood, and I couldnt ask her where in hell she tied the cheese. So I went around calling, Hyah, <unclear>Lim</unclear>! Hyah, <unclear>Lim</unclear>! There was the sound of a porch post popping outside, a snapping rope, adn it burst through the back door, dashed over to the bread box, grabbed a</p>

<p>biscuit, then leaped at me with its tongue out and its tail wagging. I got to sleep in fine shape after that. that's doing well for a pup, but wait till it's a little older!</p>
<p>I wish I knew when we're going up there. I'm looking forward to a visit with you.</p>
Love always
Dad
