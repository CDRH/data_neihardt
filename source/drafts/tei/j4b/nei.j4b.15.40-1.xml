Precious Mona:
<p>I'm enclosing $22, and you'll be coming home soon!</p>
<p>I think you might as well wait for the things you may want for the house until you get back. They can be ordered by mail just as well, I suppose, unless there are real sales on in St. Louis.</p>
<p>We had a freeze last night, and the blossoms were stiff this morning. This will not make much difference to us, but it seems a pity - such heavy bloom and the season already late.</p>
<p>That myrtle came up strong this year, and it was necessary to cut it before the grass was ready. We'll be mowing the whole lawn soon now. The bulbs are hear, and I'll get them planted, filling the sourth end of the Ozark garden behind the place where you will build the figure. I think it would be better to bank the canvas than to spread them around. (over)</p>

<p>We made a bad mistake in setting the baby figure out in the winter while it was still in a green stage. It will need some serious refairing. I'm so sorry, because that is for finest thing so far. Still, you can fix it.</p>
<p>I've thought of Alice, and all of you, a lot; and I'll be so glad when the cloud lifts up there and Alice is well again. Kisses for her.</p>
<p>Sig + Max have been sending letters all over the cosmos! I think we will do well, at the worst; but I do wish something might break to lift me again.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if you can make a good bus connection at Springfield. Maybe we should get you there. You'd better call the bus station and find out about the connection. Then you'll still have time to let us know if we should get you at Springfield, and at what time. Hope you can get an early morning bus form St. L.</p>
Endless love
Jno.
