Dear Sig:
<p>I went to a Negro woman medium last Saturday, and was impressed by her accurate knowledge of many things I could check. I asked <hi rend="underline">no</hi> questions and gave <hi rend="underline">no</hi> answers. I'm writing to tell what she said of you. She described You well enough for identification, said you were much taller but as blond as I. Then she said: "Tell him that what he dreams and plans will be very proud of him." (The latter has been true quite a spell already!) Note that she had no sort of lead from me. I might not have had a son, for all she could know by normal means - She knew all. The rest of us too, and was strikingly exact.</p>
<p>Sig, I'm a heluva good <sic>binness</sic> man! Half a mind to join Rotary, <unclear>Kiwass's</unclear> and the Lions!</p>

<p>Something will happen to change matters, of course. Something always does!! In the meanwhile we aren't unhappy by a long way.</p>
<p>Ill be backing after next Tuesday - for three weeks. Have a lovely room (like a good hotel room) with a kitchenette in a pantry.</p>
<p>I do want to see you all! The little girls! Getting big so fast, and Max already getting gray hair! Poor old lady! And I'll bet you often feel almost old yourself when you come home fogged in the evenings. I get sort of kinda tired doing silly things at speed all day, with phones buzzing at me almost constantly. Can't do a job until it's done, Every minute or so that I - phone buzzes &amp; I have to answer. it's sort of funny but it tires one a bit - quite a bit. If it were <hi rend="underline">only</hi> the phone!</p>
Endless love to all four,
Dad Gaki
<note>Don't forget the Great Spirit. that is always sweet and good &amp; beyond all <sic>wordly</sic> wisdom.</note>
