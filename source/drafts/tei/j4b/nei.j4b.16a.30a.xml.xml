Dearest Mama:
<p>Here is an article I know you'll be thrilled to read, since Dad &amp; all of us have from it received our first knowledge of <underline>just how</underline> the Germans pulled the Norway stunt. The article starts on other side. <underline>Please save</underline> this, Dad says.</p>
<p>We are all well &amp; happy &amp; send loads of love to you &amp; Joan &amp; Elaine.</p>
<p>Will write you more later. Mrs. Boyles says I'm about ready for some 'luck'.</p>
Endless love,
Sig
