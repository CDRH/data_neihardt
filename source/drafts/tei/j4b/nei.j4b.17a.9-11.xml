Darling Alice:
<p>You dear letter, so full of your "doings" made us very glad - in fact I read your letter <sic>alloud</sic> after reading it to myself so we all enjoyed it. Daddy will answer your questions. He said 6 being the holy number would be better but not necessary. The costumes sound O.K. You have receieved the drum by now also the words. Daddy recalled them independently from Hilda who sent us a copy too.</p>
<p>I'll send you the wigs - but want you to tell me definitely what else you want in the way of sacred symbols. You may of course have any and all things as you will Keep them in safety and see that everyone respects their dignity.</p>
<p>The shorts leave tomorrow. The dye comes out in water so be careful not to get white things mixed with them - You</p>

<p>may make some very good connections for your future there Alice - I hope you do. We don't think it at all silly to teach the wee ones to dance and use creative immagination - How I would have loved that when I was a youngster! Children should do just that sort of thing and are lucky to have teachers show them how.</p>
<p>I am glad you are learning to dive - you should be lovely diving! We all are so well and grateful for our Home, for Daddy's glorious Work and for you dear, fine children.</p>
<p>Please tell me if you need a night gown, a slip or a dress - or do you need all of these - Please tell me the truth in your very next letter -</p>
Always loving you,
Your<strike/> devoted
