Dearest Mom &amp; Hil:
<p>Meant to have written you before this. Was so happy to receive your last letters. They were really sweet adn characteristic of you both! Ol is writing you to enclose in this.</p>
<p>We've all been having a swell time even tho' Sig has been having teeth pulled, etc. He is feeling good this morning after having the several pulled. I suppose Max has written all about that, tho', so I won't say more.</p>
<p>We've been enjoying having all the folks here. Would be even nicer if we could all get together. I imagine there'll be quite a gap in our lives after we are alone now. I'm trying to play sick this morning. I have only a cold in my vocals and a cold in my nose, but Max is insisting on doing everything for me. She's a grand kid.</p>
<p>Hilda, we want you to believe that we thoroughly miss you, and it was so sweet of you to write us such a lovely letter about how you liked being with us. Al got your things yesterday and you'll probably get them the first of the week.</p>
<p>Alice is at present catching up on her diary. She should write, but probably you'll hear from your youngest, Mom, when she arrives in Branson!</p>
<p>Ol wants to write now, so I'll call it a letter. There really isn't much to say except that we're pleased over the way Sig has reacted to his dental work, so far.</p>
Loads of love to both,
Eny
<p>Give our best to Lache, Hil. And has he been put in the dog house yet?</p>
<p>Lots of <sic>lovvins</sic> to Joanie &amp; Elanie.</p>
