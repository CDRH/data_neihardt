<p>Have been thinking of you constantly, &amp; am missing my fine girl more all the time! 
Last nite - the 8:55 date was certainly not for-gotten.
I was sitting in a restaurant &amp; listen-ing to "Ky-B-X" giving the exact time! 
Not a bite was eaten 'til time to "sign off" </p>

<fw type="curatorial">104</fw>

<p>at 9:05 P.M. 
It was a hard day for us in Springfield-you know how the women's clubs get people to spend a whole afternoon in the entertaining them! 
So that's what made us "fagged out"!
Stopped in for a few minutes at Sutton's &amp; had an unusually remarkable reading from the psychic! She is surely the most unusual one I've been to </p>

<fw type="curatorial">105</fw>
<fw type="authorial">-3-</fw>

<p>I have a number of things I wish to talk to you about! Nothing but good, &amp; very interesting! Seems "too good" (so we used to say)! 
I had to take it so slowly form Spr. to Rolla to keep from arriving to early; so just happened to run across a "66" Chrysler in trouble! I couldn't (at first) convince the Dutch - man of being able to fix him up - so</p>

<fw type="curatorial">106</fw>
<fw type="authorial">-4-</fw>

<p>I bet him a carton of cigars against a carton of cigs that I'd fix it!
I got it in shape for him &amp; drove him a-round for a while! It was strange how happy &amp; convinced he was after seein' his Chrysler do "56" all the way up a long grade! The fellow wanted to give me the money equivalent of a carton of Chester-fields, but I took $.25 instead! </p>

<fw type="curatorial">107</fw>
<fw type="authorial">-5-</fw>

<p>The poor fellow was out of job &amp; I could see that he had made a bet too large for his own good! WEll, so much for this commonplace subject! 
I am going to play again tonite; &amp; with my sweet girl always with me (in tho't at least)- I'm sure to do well! Please take care of yourself, dear girl - you know - you might fall off of </p>

<fw type="curatorial">108</fw>
<fw type="authorial">-6-</fw>

<p>the front porch &amp; be in a more danger-ous situation than I'm in while driving so much! C? Ha! Ha! Eh??! "Big teaser" - wish you could tease me now! I love my sweet girl &amp; nothing can make me think any other way about it! 
Mrs. Sutton should have you a letter soon in answer to yours! She promised me she would! 
I'm so looking for-ward to getting a</p>

<fw type="authorial">-7-</fw>
<p>letter from you that at time I have an awful heartache! As soon as I get to St. Louis I'll write you about something good I foudn out! Dad is genuinely pleased over yours &amp; my association with eachother, &amp; this is quite im-portant in certain ways! Is it not? I've had great pleasure in "high-hallin'" the girls involved in the many receptions &amp; will continue to have fun that way!</p>
