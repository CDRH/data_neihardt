Dear Oddie &amp; Enot:
<p>I've enjoyed your letters and though of you a lot, but haven't written anything I didn't have to write. I'm getting near the end, &amp; will be sending the last copy, Enot, within this month. It's good to hear of your many happy activities and to know that the Stranger is knocking lustily at the door! More power to him or her, &amp; I don't jiggle the basket.</p>
With love always
Dad
