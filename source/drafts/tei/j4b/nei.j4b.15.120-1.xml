Darling Enid:
<p>It is <underline>so</underline> dear of you to have the girls stay with you till their vacation, both of them, and I do hope it will not be too much of a burden. They are eager to be at your home, they always write so euthusiastically about the weekends at your place. Now Daddy is planning to go to Overland on the 15th of July to get the girls and the Radio and whatever else Hilda wants to send home then.</p>
<p>The folks went to Springfield yesterday and returned with a brand new lighter weight Hudson. It is a beauty and will be more economical.</p>
<p>Sig had to have 2 more molars pulled. He is having such a hard time, poor boy. The teeth were very long rooted and the dentist had a dreadful time getting them out. Maxie was there and she felt all tired out when she got back home, so you may know how Sig felt! The babies and I had a good time at home. We never have any trouble, and always are so happy and peaceful when we are alone together. They are the "goodest" Wubs!</p>
<p>I am glad you had your other Mom with you and that you did a lot of things together. That was nice. I hope the girls are not the cause of her leaving?</p>
<p>I am worried over Hildas' state of health, and hope she will really benefit a lot by her vacation, and also by the relief it is</p>
121
<p>sure to be for her to be with you from now until the 15th.</p>
<p>There is little news to give you but we are all happy and Sig alone has had any thing serious to worry over. I feel about certain that will soon be a matter of the past - very shortly.</p>
<p>He keeps getting new contracts, so that things look much brighter.</p>
Loving you and Ollie
devotedly,
always you
Mama.
