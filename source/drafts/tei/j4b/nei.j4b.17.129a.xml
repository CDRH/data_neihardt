Tues. eve.
Dear Mom &amp; Hilda &amp; darlings:
<p>Just back from Ford and Sig had one lower right wisdom tooth pulled - painful but very fine job - no laceration, very littler bleeding. But - it was a decayed tooth clear to the root with a slight pus sack on the root end. So that is one less. Six to go! Ford will do everything, extractions, fillings &amp; plate for $100. One-half down. Rest in November. SO its half paid for. <strike>I o</strike></p>
<p>I get a neat little pair of white shoes for $1.97. I'm not getting anythign else because I sorta feel right now I shouldn't. Hoever my needs are little and cheap at that. Prices for womens things are certainly absurd. Your shoes are exactly liKe Hilda's only white and a size seven!</p>
<p>Tell my Joan that her pacKage will be on the way tomorrow or Thursday. Your shoes will be in it too.</p>
<p>Jennings said Sig's blood texted OK. &amp; that there would be nothing he culd do until the <strike>jaw</strike> teeth were extracted. We are all very happy here.</p>
<p>Kisses to my sweetheart babies &amp; love from us all to</p>
You &amp; Hil.
<p>We may have to be here until wednesday of next wK. SO sorry - but we must maKe hay while the sun shines.</p>
