Dear Enat and Oddie:
<p>I arrived here yesterday and have been lying around getting pep for a week's ordeal - eight stunts in view already and some dinners. Heluva mess! I do feel well now, and I'm over that cursed fluey spell. Don't feel very smart, but I defend on the Lord for that, being a Christian. At 8 P.M. I face the Louis, and I have to discuss Contemporary American Literature. Big posters all over the place say so, and I guess it's so. I don't want to.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, damned if I have much to say in this letter. I raided four pawn shops today + got some moderatrly nice things - 21 pieces - not expensive. I haven't forgotten your ring, Old Lady Enat. Will be going <unclear>into</unclear> that soon! Have been dreaming about it, and also working on all-stone rings - one of crystal and one of rose quartz. My outfit works finely, + very hand-made diamond drill is a dark.</p>

<p>Max and the Wubs were well I happy when I left. Everything as it should be, of I know my catechism. Spring is bursting out down there, and I'm eager to get back and to work on Jed. This fiffling lecture business has now killed 7 weeks with no Jed. Too bad, but so it goes. It's a <unclear>peewee</unclear> world, in the main, sure enough. But I'm happy. (I am not! I am too!)</p>
<p>It's good that Mama can be up there, altho Max and I think the leaves a heck of a big hole when she is away. Inadentally, Old Lady Max is a dear. What a bunch of fine gals we have! It's amazing. Six of them - or 7 if you count <unclear>Boby Jaine turel</unclear>, the little dickens!</p>
Love to you both always,
Dad
<p><underline>Now for the Lious!</underline></p>
