Dear Enat and Oddie:
<p>We're all delighted with what we have heard and what we've seen in the photos. Looks as tho you are about as rurally and pleasantly, situated as we are here. I'm eager to see the place, but it will be late in November, if I get there at all this year.</p>
<p>Sig and I will start for Florida Thursday. I wish we were all starting for the moon! After listening to the radio for some weeks, we've arrived at the illuminating conclusion that Frankland is at Ger with Eng adn Warmany. We are starting a movement whereby we hope to mobilize the moral force of the world, not to mention the conscience of mankind and the Constitution, to the end that combatants may be compelled to humanize their war in keeping with the following regulations!</p>
<p>1.-Fart bombs and laughing gas to be used exclusively for long range fighting.
3. Buckets of s--t to be substituted for bayonets in close fighting.</p>

<p>Will you not join us in the good work? Thanks and God bless you! You may send your check to the central office at Branson, resting assured that it will be put to good use. We are going to need a large number of tank trucks for transporting the ammunition.</p>
With love always,
Dad.
