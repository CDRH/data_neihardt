Enid Darling:
<p>So glad you both like the carpet! I've been gathering up things for you and "M.L." putting them in the Martha W. for you. Sig will take them all up with him. I've baked once and washed once and made a big lot of sugar cookies since we returned. Daddy is getting ahead nicely on Jed. We have emptied the Pool together and brought the fish in the house. Daddy will reline the pool as it has leaks in it. Today it is Winter again. Will send you <sic>Jonquills</sic> also - Loads of love form us 3 to you three!</p>
Devotedly
Mama and Daddy.
