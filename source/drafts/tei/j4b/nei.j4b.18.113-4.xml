Precious ladies!
<p>Just got back from Ill. U. Had a fine time, although the heat nearly got me for about a half hour before my first talk. In the evening I was in an air-conditioned theater.</p>
<p>Met a Dr. Frenz of Goettingen University, Germany - <unclear/> professor, who is returning to Germany Aug. 31. He is about 30 years old &amp; very brilliant - knows his Greek &amp; loves it etc. etc. He <strike/> is eager to write about me &amp; my work in Germany <unclear/> Journals, &amp; wants all my books sent to him in Hanover. Also, I'm to send him any notes, Geographical &amp; otherwise, that will keep him give an all-around view of me &amp; my stuff. He asked if I'd care to lecture at German universities (in English, of course) and I said I'd certainly like to. So that's something too, maybe.</p>
