Dearest Children:
<p>In loading the car Daddy got a "Hexenschuss" so I am ironing his poor hip - and as it is raining a cold rain we fear to start out today as it may freeze etc. Dont' worry, and Know that we are starting for Overland as soon as Daddy and the weather are better.</p>
Love, 
Mama-Mother
