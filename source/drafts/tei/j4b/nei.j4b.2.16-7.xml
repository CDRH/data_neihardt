Dear Ones:-
Just arrived here from Brookings. Was out to dinner at Dean Brown's house cast serving nice bunch of people there. I finished up here tomorrow evening, & start home Wednesday noon. Will arrive in Branson at 11 o'clock Friday; and I'll be mighty glad to get home. I'm sick of showing off, I can tell you. Most people aren't worth the <unclear/> one masters on them, tho' cetianly I've had fine ceception everywhere. It's winter here. 22 below. zero at Brookings. 
Sioux Falls is a big town- 30,000 people. 
Well, no more until I get home. Won't get my mail until tomorrow. I'm at due here until then & I don't profane to show up until I must, for I hate the damn nonsense. Lots of love 
Jno 
Last night (Sunday night) at about 2 or 3 I was wakened by hearing Mama say <del/> "John! John! Hurry!" yet I felt well & cetianly wasn't at all homesick or anxious <del>about</del> about home. 
I'll get home with about 260 clear.
