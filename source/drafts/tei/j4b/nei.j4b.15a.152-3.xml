Precious Mona:
<p>A wire this morning from Sig says he will come after me here, arriving Thursday evening. That's a good <unclear/>, so I have a lot of stuff I'd have to express home; and, anyway, the bus reaches St. Louis at midnight, while the train &amp; sleeper would cost mroe than the extra drive. I don't know when we'll come to you. We may stay in a cabin camp Friday night &amp; be with you <underline>early Saturday</underline> morning. We'll work that out when Sig arrives. <underline>If</underline> I can leave here early Friday, we might come right to you &amp; hope to get part way home on Friday, staying in some cabin camp.</p>
