Dear Ollie &amp; Enot:
<p>Thanks for another fine newsy letter. I'm not replying now - just sending you our sugar cards to be used in getting more <underline>canning</underline> sugar. We cannot use them here for that purpose without permission from your board, and we don't care enough to get the <strike/> permission.</p>
<p>You will be perfectly justified in getting canning sugar for us as a part of your family, as you do not know that we will not be there. So use them &amp; fire them back to us as soon as</p>
-2-
<p>you have used them so that we can get our ordinary supply in a couple of weeks from now.</p>
<p>Everythign is lovely. Hello Nei old timer! Spinach, tar, hotdo!! You can have our teeth back as soon as Gaki gets some others.</p>
Endless love
Dad
