Dear Daddy, Mama, Everyone,
<p>Rec'd letters and the lovely article about you, Hilda. Also bread, which we have already eaten with much gusto. Mama, you are all so dear - I feel proud and grateful beyond words to be part of you.</p>
<p>Just about ready for bed after good day. It is cool here. I called Mrs. Seymour, who says to tell you Mr. Seymour is to be operated on for glocoma a wk. from Friday! It means sight or loss of it - so pray for him. Such fine people!</p>
<p>We shall not leave for Detroit till middle or so of next wk. for haven't yet lead suffered rehearsals. Couldn't have a rehearsal Wed. because club closed, so we're to have dress music rehearsal tomorrow with Countess, friends, adn agents looking on! I really hate having to use so much of your money to get started by really I'd have no time for other work in addition to rehearsal. Enought money for another wk. or so, some make-up, etc. is all I'll need from now on, be it I must have enought just to tide me over. Hope you do understand how I <underline>don't</underline> like to drain you now.</p>
Your Alice
