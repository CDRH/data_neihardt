Sat. Morning.
Dear Sig &amp; Max:
<p>This seems to me the best folder yet, and I'm happy about it.</p>
<p>Sorry the change in material was so expensive, but there's a great advantage in the change, which was made after the war started. The present farm certainly stresses the natural note effectively.</p>
<p>it's good that Shannon and the Holms hit it off so well, and I'm much more hopeful now. Perhaps <underline>Mrs</underline> Holm can handle the job when Elmer is tied up with "business". She's very intelligent surely.</p>
<p>Thanks for the $12. You speak more about the 15th; but ten a month should be enough for the Wubs, and we'll be all right if Nebraska does moderately well. Mama &amp; I <underline>do</underline> appreciate your feeling.</p>
<p>The Wubs are happy. They &amp; Mama gave me a lovely birthday yesterday, <underline>not</underline> on the 8th. Miss Bachmer helped. This morning it seems old 'Laine may be getting her spell of chicken pox, but it will not be serious! Joan is all over her spell. Precious darling kids!</p>

<p>Sig, did you have a talk with Mrs. Boyles between Dec 31 and Jan 7? I had two letters from her on those dates, and the second conflicts with the first. I hope the second is right! Mediums are certainly interesting &amp; sometimes astonishing; but they can't tell what is of super-normal origin and what is not. Mrs. B. is a dear, and how she does want is to succeed! Bless her heart! I'm afraid asking them questions is likely to get them off the track. But if she was right in either letter, we need have no worries! I'll keep <underline>both</underline> as a test. Remember Pearl Harbor!</p>
Love always
Dad
<p>if it weren't for your planning with Con. Concerts, I'd be out on a limb right, just now; and you must knwo that I do appreciate what you're doing.</p>
