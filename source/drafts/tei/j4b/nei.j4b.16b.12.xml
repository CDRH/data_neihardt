<p>Washington Headquaters. While in the employ of Lord Fairfax of Greenway Court, this building was from time to time, during 1749-53, used by George Washington as a Surveyor's Office.</p>
<p>While engaged in supervising the erection of Fort Loudoun 1756-57, Lt. Col. Washington then in command of the frontier occupied this building.</p>
<p>This was so interesintg and we stood by the same fireplace where the Father of our Country had warmed his feet 200 years ago! What would he think of our government today. Would he be a Democrat? I think not.</p>
