Dear Mama:
Your birthday letter to me meant a great deal and I have read it a number of times. I am so glad if you can see something in my work to justify all youhave gone through. You surely deserve a lot of love, and I'm afraid I haven't shown enough; but you are very dear to me, more than you generally realize. You say that you have "blundered and blundered", and of course you've blundered - everybody does blunder petifully; but you've been brave, Mona. And I know that better now than I ever did before. I see it, so plainly. You fought in a bewildered way against things so much bigger than yourself and with so little immediate victory. I always knew this but never so well as I know it now. 
Last night I dreamed that a house was burning. The flame was coming from an upstairs window. I saw you climb up the side of the house to the window & try to put out the fire, and there you were caught with the flames lapping around you. I called to you to hang on and I'd get a ladder, but you said it was all right & jumped. Then you tried to look as tho' you weren't hurt & tried to hobble off. It was a silly dream, but there was a lot of you in it.

I can't know just what my work shall mean in the long run; but of course a share of it is yours. I won't get much in doing it & neither will you. But getting is an illusion for very young minds. The older ones know better. 
I am so glad I have you and Mona and the children. 
Sometime I'll write something in. Prose-not long but full of a <unclear/> hell. and beauty all about you and life & the pity and glory of it. And if I ever write that, as I surely think I shall, it will can't. 
You should read the Fool's walker when you think I forget what you have done. 
John.
