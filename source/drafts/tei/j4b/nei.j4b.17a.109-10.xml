Dear Ollie, Enot and Nei:
<p>You'd be swamped with letters if I wrote to you every time I thought of you. It's a joy to hear the happy news of old Nei's progress, and <udnerline>so often</udnerline>every day, I feel the precious, darling bundle of him and see his sweet face. Do on it, we should be near enough to see him every day. This is a wonderful time for you, and we rejoice with you.</p>
<p>We had a little snow yesterday - maybe a half inch. A gleam of sun can fix that.</p>
<p>Surely the world -plat is thickening fast, adn it's not pleasant to think about. I wonder a bit how long it may be until we stand alone on a hostile planet. They should all be exhausted and ready for some sort of working plan before Nei's whikers sprout. That's a comforting thought.</p>
<p>Mellett has written twice lately. <underline>Seems</underline> in earnest. Maybe they <underline>will</underline> let me in.</p>
Love for all three of you,
individually and collectively,
Dad.
