Dearest Girl: 
It was a joy to receive a letter direct from you again! Something like six weeks since the last one! And I'm glad you told me something of the way you've been feeling. You couldn't tell, of course; but I can imagine a good deal of it. I'm glad we got you out of the hospital will do, home is better in every way. I know how hard it was to write me, and I'm grateful for the effort it cost you. It is so good to know that you have Virginia to look after you. What if it were a cold, mechanical sort of nurse! I surely don't begrudge anything I pay her. Surley it cannot be many weeks before you can be gotten out into the garden where you can hear the fountain & see the stars. That will be good for you. The page is all made up and corrected. Now I'll start in making another. I don't know when I'll take ^a vacation or what I'll do with a vacation.

I'm entitled to three weeks on pay. Perhaps I can interest Bovard in the Salt Desert Trip. If so, I would probably go out there. But Sig needs to hear the Indians sing, so that he can work up a radio stunt. I suppose the way ahead will clear up soon enough, somehow. 
Evidently my page is giving satisfaction, and there is no opposition at all. Former literary editors have had a tough tiem with the stuff, for some reason. But no one is in any way antagonistic to me. Bovard is very friendly. I never see Pulitzer. He is away now, but when he is here I doubt see him. Our cool spell is about at an end, but it's not yet hot. This spell must have been a great help to you. 
Many thanks for that letter. I wish you were nearer. Wish you could be here! 
Endless love, dearest Girl!
