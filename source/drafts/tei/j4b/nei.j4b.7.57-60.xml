<salute>My dear good little girl;</salute>
</opener>

<p>again I am acknowledging still another beautiful gift, just like you so lovely and proper and as I said "just like you," many thanks dear girl-I assure you the opening of the package Xmas Eve was a source of unexpected pleasure and gave me a thrill who I suppose by the calendar should have left such things by the wayside long since I spent my xmas and birthday alone - but "Santa" did his best to amek amends for it - and you should see how beautifully he remembered </p>

<fw type="curatorial">58</fw>
<p>me, and dearie your's "Lead all the rest"-John and his family intended driving down on the 21st which was my birthday but when the time came it had to be given up, there had been so much rain and part of the road to St Louis is not yet finished - and the risk was to great, so I was alone - but not un-happy - tho not very well I am content and very comfortable, Oh Miss Piper please plan to drive down here next summer with your mother and father too if he will - I shall just go on planning us tho </p>

<fw type="curatorial">59</fw>
<p>it were a sure thing - I had a card from "Miss Fish" Preston - she seems very happy and a good mother no doubt - 
Mona and John are doing well, the children too are just striding at a great pace in school, Enid graduates from the Kirkwood High School ^in June and is taking Stenography extra Sigurd is doing wonderfully in his music Hilda is at the head of her classes all older children, Alice sings like a lark-just a microscopic view of the family, I could go on at length but will forbear </p>

<fw type="curatorial">60</fw>
<p>Did you have a nice Xmas-I know you did if you were home, remember me to your father and mother,
Just loads of love to yourself and many thanks for the lowly gift, most lovingly-</p>
