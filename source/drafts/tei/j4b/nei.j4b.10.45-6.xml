Darling Hilda: 
Daddy says to tell you that he will come to Springfield to get you and Elanita tomorrow as usual. 
Too bad this letter had to go so late. 
I am afraid to drive up as I <del>all</del> always get the headache and I don't want to be sick this time when you girls are home. 
Love as always darling - 
Mamma.
