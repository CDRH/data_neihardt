And yet you are better off for being near to learn, minute by minute, Mona's exact condition.

And yet somewhere deep nothing I feel Mona will be spared. -.-. Her fear of being an expense to you, of not working herself to death to word this, instead of receiving quiet & living another to perform many I labor, in a run down nervous state is no doubt the reason of her present state - miles if be, which pray God it not the case - Dr Mitchell lead not licked the brow-abcess as it shoudl have <unclear/>? Is this the

Other Mother.
