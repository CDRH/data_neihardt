Dear Enot: 
No doubt you've seen Sig and the Girls since their return, and heard about our week together and how we missed you and Ollie no day passes that I do not htink of you many times, and all I miss about the P-D episode is the daily contact with you. But I feel strongly that somehow you and Ollie will be near us again - and who knows how much I may yet need a secretary? It's an illogical world, and therefore very hopeful, since almost anything can happen - and I don't expect anything really bad. I do expect good. 
I haven't actually written any lines on "Jed" yet, but I'm beginning to feel full of it again, and some lines have come along with nebulous things that are mostly <del/> mood. I know it will be one of my best. I've been storing up energy surprisingly fast, and (over)

I eat gorgeously - whatever happens to be handy. There are no dead spots anywhere in me now. Often the old headlong, glorious <del/> feeling takes hold of me. 
The days here are marvelous - and the nights! 
The other day a wasp who lives in our garage mistook me for an enemy and stung me - a good hard, stinging sock in the <del/> elbow. he gave me all he had, sure enough. But it was a damned queer business, because I didn't dislike the pain or feel even a moment's resentment at the wasp. Soemthing strangely pleasant about the experience, and I was happy. There was a red spot of a dime's size for a few hours, but no swelling x
I don't mean to make much of this, and I'm not suggesting that one should <del/> like a wasp's sting, or anything else sentimental. but it made me wonder again. I may yell the next time!! And slap hell out of the wasp too, maybe! 
Endless love, Old Lady!
