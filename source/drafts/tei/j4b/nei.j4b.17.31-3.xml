Dearest Children:
<p>You are right about the washing - and I am glad you do not want it. I'll be so glad though it I can be of help to you and to the Wubs. I understand that Hilda has a great deal of extra work for <unclear>Honbausak</unclear> Sons, and that she hires Maxine at times when possible. So may be I could go in and take the Wubs out in the Park on certain days so that Maxie can type for Hilda - I don't Know much about things but I feel sure I shall be able to help all 'round and helping makes me happy. So it is quite selfish on my part.</p>
<p>Daddy is really looking forward to you and to the basement with the freedom of going outdoors when he pleases and being out of the way. I am so glad because that means that I can be with you children sooner than I ex</p>

<p>pected. It would be wonderful to spend February and part of March with you providing things work out as pleasantly for you as I know they will for us. We have been very fortunate to be able to sell first editions out of our Library - and we hope to be able to make several hundred dollars that way.</p>
<p>I think I'll put our washing machine over at Mrs Cantwells' while we're gone, letting her use it in return for looking after our plants and Mr George Cat.</p>
<p>Loads of Love goes with this is very little news to you both</p>
from your devoted
Mama.Mother.
