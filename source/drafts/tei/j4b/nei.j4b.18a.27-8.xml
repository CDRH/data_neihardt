Dear Ollie &amp; Enot:
<p>Mama has asked me to say hello to you and to thank you for the pictures. The large side-view gave exactly what she lacked, so she is well fixed. Many thanks. She'll write later.</p>
<p>We'll have company from the 23rd to about the 26th, and we'll need some more eatin' sugar. If you'll fire us the cards, we'll get the eatin' sugar and fire 'em back by return mail. You must have them for canning.</p>
<p>Grapes are $1 per bushel here - dandies!</p>
<p>We want to see our Boy! He pops into my head way many times a day and gives me a tickly thrill. Bless his bright sweet soul! No news yet.</p>
Love always,
Dad.
