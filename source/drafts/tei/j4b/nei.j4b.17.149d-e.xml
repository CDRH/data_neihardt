Tuesday morning
Dearest Daddy and Mama:
<p>The big bay is here at last; Alice seems to be feeling just fine, and I believe she had a good rest last night. She is not going to her lesson today - we both thought it would be foolish, and I told her that you thought she should not. So instead she is going to get a permanent; she is going to have it done by Mrs. Hoffmann this morning. Then she will come back home and get a good rest again this afternoon so that she will be in fine shape this evening.</p>
<p>I am really getting very excited myself about this. I trust I live over it!</p>
<p>Enid called yesterday, and we had a lovely chatover the phone. We may go out there for a steak roast this week end. Sigurd wants to do something like that.</p>
<p>This is all for now. I shall write you a good, long letter tomorrow all about the big event!</p>
<p>Alice feels just all right about your not being here.</p>
With endless love as ever,
Hilda
