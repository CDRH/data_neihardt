<p>Today I was so thrilled when Mrs Mac Querter called me on the phone and said she wanted her husband to write a real good recommendation for Enid, as "they" had written to ask for one! So that must mean they are thinking of promoting you: they asked for information about you as secre-tary, and Oh Enid, I know they are getting ready to take you out of that room with those common girls, where you do not belong!! I knew they would soon realize what you were and they like you all the more for being willing to do any thing at the start. Mr. </p>

<fw type="curatorial">92</fw>
<p>Thompson also has written a recommendation just recently! I am all excited now to know what it means! 
I have not heard from you for ages it seems- but I know that I am just un-reasonable - and that you really have done your part - So I'll just reread your last letter and amy be a couple of others - and feel satisfied! Mrs Spurlock also was so happy to get a letter form you - so was Maxine. 
Branson has been all excitement over its Basketball team - it has been win-ning every game lately against South Western Mo towns, and jsut this after-noon it lost in Springfield against Wheat-

<p>land.-Daddy,Alice and I are going-to Springfield tomorrow - I am going to your medium! Do you remember her telling you that "they" had called for references in your home town? Well they have! As usual she missedin time. How I wonder if you will work for that oldish man she spoke of!--
Daddy has been judging the literary efforts of High School pupils here it was a contest that the Study Club organized - It has been most interesting for it has brought some </p>

<p>very remarkable talent to the pond. Daddy is so interested in them, especially two young men and two girls. One of the boys is from Rockaway - one from the S. of U. one girl from Hollister and one from Branson High!-
I'll let Max tell about her prospective "move"-
I hope you received my last 2 letters. This is teh third one I have written you since receiving you last - Loads of love to Amama and to my own sweet dear good girlie </p>
