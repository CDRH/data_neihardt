<p>Thanks for your dear letter - Am glad you feel kind toward all the folks as they do to you. I too was surprised by their sudden move - Had no such idea till it happened. Sorry you were not properly informed till the man appeared for furniture! - They <underline>are</underline> very very busy I know, and of course so are you! Hug my baby boy for his Nanny and kiss each other</p>
for your devoted old Mama
