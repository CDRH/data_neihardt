Friday Morning
Dearest Mona:
<p>A letter from you and those from Hiddy, Enat &amp; Ollie have convinced me that you are really getting along well now, and I'm relieved. I was afraid you might be having serious <unclear>complicotious</unclear>.</p>
<p>I wrote in the letter to Enat &amp; Oddie about affairs here, &amp; you'll see it - so I needn't repeat. I've been getting a little deeper under their skins.</p>
<p>I wish you could be here with me, and if you were well enough, I'd insist but for the money. You can imagine that I've been pretty much alone. One more week <strike>or a little less</strike> and I'll be on my way to St. Tom's. May be able to leave on Friday. Hope so.</p>

<p>It seems a year since Sig and I started for the South. I'm so eager to see how you fixed things up at home.</p>
<p>I do think it's wonderful that we are really a <unclear/> group, caring for each other. I know I have no reason ever to feel unhappy - no reason in the <underline>long</underline> view. I've been extremely fortunate in so many ways.</p>
<p>I'm all right, but for some shortness of breath, which doesn't bother much in speaking. Happily I have no big hall to fill and can use practically the normal voice.</p>
<p>Everyone here is truly kind. I do love you, Big Fat.</p>
