<salute>Dear Mama:</salute>
</opener>

<p>I arrived here last evening at 7:45 and had a good night's sleep. This morning I took a long walk - through Boston Common, fast old King's Church and the Old. State House to Fanevil Hall. The latter ("Cradle of American liberty") is a market  you can buy cheese there! 
This is surely a beautiful <del/> city. 
I read at Wellesley at 4:15 this afternoon  must <del/> go to a dinner afterwards. Wish I could dodge the dinner. 
I notice that two of my stocks have gone up - one $10 a share  the

<p>other a little more. I think I'll were an order to sell tomorrow. Hope today's market is strongly so that I may cash my profits of yesterday. All my stocks are up a bit, except one  it is a good stock, so I needn't worry. 
I hope Wellesley's crowd will come across as other crowds have done. Can't see why they should not. Perhaps I should have afternoon clothes, but I'll have to wear my new street suit, which is a very good one. 
Statter Hotel has a radio in every room - rather nice. I heard a lot of jazz last night. There seemed to be nothing else on the air. Mama, how I wish I could be down there a week with you! I think we should fear to spend Xmas with you or at least the nearest Saturday</p>

<p>I'll not wake over $100 on this hard long journey, but, my salary goes on, so I'm ahead. 
I came through Washington Philadelphia  New York yesterday. Had no time to stop at Washington. May stop in New York tomorrow  see Lotham of Macmillans. 
Johns wants me to go on at $110 per week. Said they had no change in mind, but didn't want to raise salary now. I think I could have gotten a raise if I had been like other people. 
I do hope you are feeling well, Mama, and that you are reasonably happy. I want to live in Branson

<p>again &amp; finish my cycle &amp; several other books-probably prose. The strenuous life in civilization isn't worth what it costs. Your life there is so much better. YOu are near the real things - the only real things. All I regret about your being there so that you must be above. That ought to be changed, &amp; will be. 
Mona has some bully work to exhibit, &amp; I do hope she will get some satisfaction out of the exhibit, I want it to make her happier. </p>
