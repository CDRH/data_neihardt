So good to see your dear picture! 
My own Darling,
So many thanks for your good long letter.-I need such boosters because at night I think and worry and by the time the folks are ready to get up I'm <unclear/> got every thing so twisted I can hardly live Tell Enid I was terribly hap-py over what she said about Joanie - and I'll be so glad to get snaps of all of you I received your dear notes written the 4th, and was so glad you thought of me. I was worrying nearly all day

for fear you might all be on the Highway and have on accident. There are so ma-ny of them all festive days. 
I tried to stand up today for the children but could not. How much longer of this help lessness, Oh God?! 
John dear the garden is past redeeming - flowers all dead and as I understand it from Virginia where they were there it a low not of weeds. But I will try to jet a man some way or other to cut off dead things, Tris, golden glow etc and we may be can save the circles of shrubs and hedge. I don't want to think about this it makes me weak so please don't you dear - Loads of Love 
Mona.
