Tuesday afternoon 
Dear Mama and mona and the Wubs!-
I got my first nights' sleep last night. have had three settings. Yesterday sat from 10 a.m to 5 p.m. Today from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. well set tomorrow from 8 am to 10 a.m., then buy some things & go to Pender. 
The portrait will be very fine. Walla is a painter. He was for years chief instructor of painting at the

Chicago Art Institute. Recently one of the head were of the Institute told a friend of Judges that Wallace is one of the very best painters in America, but that he lacks push to get ahead. He is a gentleman too-in the good sense. He will drive down to Branson & paint in the Ozarks. Crazy about coming & it will be bully for all fo us to have him around awhile. Maybe his presence will

give Sigurd his dream. he's no painter like that chap who was in Branson last year. His landscapes have light & mystery & yet are very realistic. he paints the whole picture with care. You, Mona, will enjoy having him there. He's 57 years old. Very common fellow &, of course, rather poor in money. I like him. His portraits of women

are rubbing, golly! he <unclear/> too, which explains his modeling in paint. 
Mona, dont' fool wtih Barr at all. If he's there yet, turn him down. And you, too, mama. I'm sorry for any simpleton, but we can't know such people. I'll be more careful in <unclear/> the next time. 
Did you get my two cards from KC. 
Therefor I told Mona not to <unclear/> Sig go

with Bars. after thinking about him I thoroughly disliked & distrusted him, tho'I still felt committed to <unclear/>. Tonight I read "into the <unclear/>". Hope you, Mama, will hear me. 
Lots of love to all 
Jno. 
I read Enid's & Sig's letters & was so glad for them. Kisses to all the Wubs. 
<unclear/> spoke of the delightful letters you write, Mama.
