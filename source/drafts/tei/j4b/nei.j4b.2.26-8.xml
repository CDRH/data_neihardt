Dearest Husband:
Here is your mail, all of it with excep-tion of your manuscript <unclear/> to Century, which I thought I had best keep for you here. The blind were there returned it together with their regrets that it was too corny for their purpose! - I have never felt 
    
27 
happier in all my life than I have today with all the newspapers, and that glorious picture of you receiving the Poet Laureate paper from that good <unclear/>. Braum you look as different from all the rest as the ideal always <unclear/> from the real. And yet, thank God, the ideal is forever being produced and <unclear/> out of the Real. I would turn 
    
28
all <unclear/> <unclear/> and aunt Martha into little angel heads floating off into dimmer and dimmer sky-distances. (if I were an Italian, and living in the Middle Ages.) leaving just you in the censer and then I would call it the "Something or other of <unclear/> John"! 
I just love that picture of you dear. I wish we coudl have it enlarged, just the central figure of you, without the others. 
I am so proud of you and feel so grateful to be your wife darling. If I may just be the one to make your movement in Lincoln!? 
Worlds of Love to you from all the Babies
and your girl 
Mona.
