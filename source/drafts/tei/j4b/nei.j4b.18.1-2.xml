<p>This is Branson, Missouri. Yesterday was Sunday and now it's Monday, 1942.</p>
Precious Hiddy &amp; Alice:
<p>That is a lovely picture, and it did us good to look at it! Strange how much you look like a couple of brothers and a sister! Really surprising! And you look so German that I wonder the Dies Committee hasn't gotten after you! Kraut!</p>
<p>Here's a notion that's come to me often, Hiddy. If and when you get married, you should hire Mr. Petri to make several nice pieces of furniture - a set in maybe - to be cherished as an heirloom. And the <unclear/> might make something special in needle-work. But the furniture shouldn't be overlooked. Such things have real meaning.</p>
<p>It seems that the Sherwin Williams (paint) hour brings out new singers. No doubt</p>

<p>you know of their "auditions of the air".</p>
<p>Alice, you're getting uglier and uglier. You are not; you are too! The very idea, you certainly are not! Whoever said such a thing? (Makes me so dam mad!) Have you been working on the lyrics any? Or any special dances? That was a very interesting long letter you didn't write us recently! Write another just like it (wasn't). Joan and Laine are good boys and George is a bad day. Mama is corpulent and very heavy on her feet. It's gluttony.</p>
Endless love
Dad (feeling slightly fluey just as Mama does &amp; he's a copycat.) 
<p>Greetings to the hardy old pioneer, and tell him I do want to see the writings. I'm hoping for evidence of an exterior source.</p>
<p>The Wubs have steadily lengthened their list of persons remembered in their prayers. About 25 now; and afterwards they remember every land of animals separately, beginning with horses and ending with "all the very little animals." Same <unclear/> for each, not any short cuts!! Requires more than a half hour at present - getting longer!</p>
<margin>at P.O. your lovely letter just arrived, Alice</margin>
