Dear Ollie and Enid:
<p>We are all thinking about your wedding anniversary and feeling geniunely happy about it. January 16th is a brightly marked day in our calendar. We love you together.</p>
<p>I meant to write from out West about the birthday box you sen me, and, golly! It was good. But I got going sooner than had planned, and have now just stopped rolling. Thanks a million to be shared by Alice for her part in the gift.</p>
<p>We do love New Mexico. Albuquerque seems a bit higher than necessary in the winter. Temperature never gets below the 30's - seldom does, Anyways; but the change between night and day is very great and comes swiftly at 5 P.M. There's a charm in the place, however - hard to forget. Farther south and lower - at Hatch. and Las Cruces - it's magical weather adn the mountains are strangely beautiful. I'd like El Paso for winter - 3700 feet.</p>

<p>We stuck no winter until we reached a point 75 miles due south of Branson. We came back through Hot Springs and Little Rock.) Here we seem to be very near the southern edge of the real winter band.</p>
<p>I'm working - worked out West too.</p>
<p>There was no snow for us after we left the east side of the Sandia Mountians on Dec. 27th until we got 75 miles from here. Too bad to have to have winter!</p>
<p>I suppose Sig &amp; I will see you in March.</p>
Love &amp; Oddie, Enot and Alice.
Dad.
