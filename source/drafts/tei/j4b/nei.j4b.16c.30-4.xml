<strike>THE ORDER OF BOOKFELLOWS</strike>
This Evening, 1940
Dear Ollie:
<p>I spoke to our Mr. Katt about your shipment of doughnut holes. It seems that Mr. Katt misunderstood the order, owing to our conversation regarding your self-propelled patriot. He was under the impression that the orifices were to be used in the connection, and therefor sent you a trial order of 1 gross of our new adjustable anuses devised for piles sufferes. He deeply regrets the error and hopes that you did not use any with your doughnuts. However, if properly fumigated, they are quite harmless, he assures me. You need not return the order, but may keep them for Xmas presents with the - compliments of Pastry &amp; Cutlery Inc. Furnished with small twigs of mistletoe, they make lovely &amp; suggestive gifts. Every gentlemen is sure to have numerous acquantances to</p>

<p>whom he would enjoy sending such a remembrance.</p>
<p>The factory is working at full blast, employing less than 100 men in afternoon shifts. And you should see the jewelled carving knife that is developing! Iron-wood handle, set with rubies in brass mountings! Iron-wood sheath, brass bound! And the <underline>swank</underline> of the whole thing. She's a lulu! It is the Family Ceremonial Knife, to belong <underline>to the Tribe</underline> &amp; be used whenever &amp; wherever the family or any section <strike/> thereof wishes to use it for special occasions - birthdays, holidays, weddings, anniversaries, Xmases, Thanksgivingses etc! O Boy, is she a darb! Today I mounted the rubies in their brass settings whcih will next be inserted into the handle. They look as tho' they grew in the brass!</p>
<p><underline>And</underline> I'm making thrilling progress with <underline>Jed</underline>! It proves richer than I'd foreseen. I'm happy with it. The hand work always flourishes as the other flourishes - or vice versa. They go together, and always did. If you see the knife <underline>now</underline>, you know how the other really is.</p>

<p>Yes, <sic>Willkie</sic> pains me very faintly too. Evidently a lovable cuss with lots of vitality and intelligence. But he has given no indication whatever that he has <underline>any</underline> philosophy or any program. In his utterances about economic matters he has <strike/> shown no more understanding of the social malady than Hoover has. <underline>He wants in</underline>, and believes that good old <sic>Binness</sic>, if unobstructed, will bring back old times. He has never suspected that it was precisely Business that ruined our society.</p>
<p>Roosevelt is, at least, headed in the general direction of the future - <underline>toward</underline> the <underline>organic state</underline>. <sic>Wielkie</sic> is looking back, if his speeches represent him. R is heading toward war <underline>deliberately</underline>; but that is quite natural &amp; inevitable at this stage of the <strike/> <unclear/> process.</p>
<p>Tell old Enat Penot that I think very often of her Great Plan, and love her more, if possible, every time. I think of what she's thinking.</p>

<p>Nanny &amp; I <underline>do</underline> have a lovely time together, but also we do miss <underline>all</underline> our people. We'll have a nice trip to Denver and other places during Oct. She is getting her clothes in order.</p>
Love to you &amp; Enat.
Dad.
<underline>Wed. forenoon</underline>
<p>More real stuff came through this morning, and I didn't seem to make it. It's glorious to feel it coming through with the precision and clarity of something that always was! I do not, and will not forget how terribly fortunate I have been and am, with all of you fine people to love, beginning with Mona and ending, <underline>for the</underline> moment, with 'Laine. And then this other <underline>too</underline>!</p>
<underline>Dad</underline>
