Darling Enid:
<p>So glad you like the Lullaby - which you should <underline>sing</underline> to little John Neihardt, not? Maybe I'll have that privilege?!</p>
<p>You are very fortunate to be so well prepared for Motherhood, darling! You'll need at <underline>least</underline> 3 dozen diapers or you'll be "running" too much. Lovely you have Mrs H. and Ollie's Mother too! Hope to Know definitely soon when we can come.</p>
Love 
Mama
