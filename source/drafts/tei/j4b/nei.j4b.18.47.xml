<underline>Thursday Morning</underline>
Precious Alice:
<p>It is thrilling to think of you actually started in public dancing! And to think that you went off alone and pushed it through yourself on the <unclear>slendest</unclear> means! We are all so eager for your first letter about the first night - and the second! That letter should be here this morning - or maybe down at Bartmer. if prayers help, you are far from being alone in your adventure. I know you will never be alone.</p>
<p>This morning at 10 I am to call the real estate man at Clayton, who, according to Mrs. Stoker, is trying to make a good exchange for us. He is supposed to have a "beautiful" Missouri River farm in mind. I'm eager to go with him and see.</p>
<p>But the news <underline>now</underline> is all where you are.</p>
<p>I rec'd that check and Ollie is cashing it today. If I had the cash now, I'd enclose something, <strike/> for I'm afraid you're badly crowded.</p>
<p>I do love you, Alice.</p>
<p>Kindest - no, affectionate - thoughts to you girl pals.</p>
Dad.
