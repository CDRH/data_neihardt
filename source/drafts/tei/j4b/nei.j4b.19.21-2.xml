[February, 1943]
Dearest Children:
<p>Thanks so very much for the money ($5.00) that you sent Daddy.</p>
<p>We are awfully grateful that you <hi rend="underline">want</hi> to help us through this most trying time, and that you are doing so. Daddy <hi rend="underline">is</hi> better but by no means well yet.</p>
<p>He has one book to review now, and besides there is a <hi rend="underline">possible</hi> good out look on a Chicago paper - but that is all problematic as yet. Amama has left us today for Cartland N.Y.</p>
<p>Hilda is planning to go to Chicago, but may wait for Albert to have his exam over with, before leaving.</p>
<p>Poor Alice has been caught on the Mexican border, waiting for George's papers and his grandmother's - and to think that they turned down continued engagements at Colossiumo's</p>

<p>not Knowing how long it takes the U.S. Government to "move". But that is one of those things!!! Maxine you'd simply adore baby Nei - he is cute now with a boy hair cut - and so much talking and crazy over machines?</p>
<p>I'm making maternity dresses for Enid.</p>
<p>We, Daddy and I, are going to go in to Hildas' to spend the night. Daddy can walk to the street care nicely now. Sunday we will spend here again at Enids!</p>
<p>I am so proud of you all - Think of the Wubs in <hi rend="underline">such</hi> a <hi rend="underline">real</hi> school! So fine they go to Sunday school too. Sigurd you are a "swell guy" -</p>
Loads of Love to you four,
from Mama. Nannie
