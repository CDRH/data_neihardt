Dear Lulu: 
This letter of Grandma's was written more than <del>nobody</del> a week ago, but she has asked me to send it. She held it because she expected to see you soon. 
She is not improving, and can't improve for long. You will come anyway. Better before than after. 
I do hope I can fill my two weeks' engagement at the municipal University of Omaha, Jan 25 to Feb 8th. The money will be needed. I was hit unmercifully a month or six weeks ago. I don't care - am glad I coudl do as I did - but I do hope I can have the 4 or 5 hundred from Omaha for what is about to happen. 
With Love, 
Jno.
