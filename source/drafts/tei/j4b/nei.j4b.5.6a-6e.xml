                <p>I dreamed about you last night &amp; awoke fearing you. Might be rich. Don't get
                    sick, please, - not till I get home anyway. Take the best of care of yourself.
                    What a cold time you must be having. 10 below! Good heavens! It's may here night
                    &amp; day - wonderful.</p> 
                <p>I have been at Bruminstool's home most of two days meeting old Indian fighters - one of them fought on the Little Big Horn. Five old men! One was Colonel Wheeler who owned the pony Crazy Horse rode in the Custer Fight. I know just how that pony looked!</p>

                <p>This is a monster tour now - such growth! Over a million here &amp; it's still
                    growing like a boom town. One can ride twenty miles or more in the city &amp;
                    not twice! The trines took me for a drive through Topango Canyon &amp; down along
                    the sea night before last. Took bunch along &amp; couldn't find a place to eat
                    it, so brought it back &amp; ate it. in their room! This evening I have to be with the Bookfellows here - Los Angeles branch. Don't want to go at all, but got roped in like a simpleton. Have been dad <unclear/> social engagements with fair success.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow I am to eat dinner at a home where Tully hangs out - a rich family of refuted intellectuals, dawn 'evr. One youngster of the family actually makes 700 a week so intellectual! I may find a way out. Why did I get roped in? Then I've got ot eat a dinner Monday evening Jan 14th.</p> 
                <p>But I'm keeping in a pretty far state of mind this trip. It will be fine to be
                    back in Branson with everybody I love close by. Mama, it's wonderful that we can
                    all be together!! I got a tremendous lot of stuff from Bruminstool. He has
