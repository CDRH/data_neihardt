THE ORDER OF BOOKFELLOWS
Jan 6 '41
Dear Enot Peanot!
<p>I want you to know that I think about the coming Wub much as I thought of you all that summer when I was writing The Stranger at the Gate. I put your letter about the new Wub in Mama's copy of that book, along with the announcement of your birth.</p>
<p>Will you feel like copying MS when we come up? I hope so. I'm just now completing the Crossing of the Desert adn the rest will not take too long. Maybe I'll feel safe enough to finish it in your basement. I'd like that.</p>
Endless love
Dad.
