<salute>Enid darling:</salute>
</opener>

<p>It was fine to get your letter yesterday, and to know that everthing is O.K. 
We have heard definitely that Chadron does not want Daddy this Summer on account of lack of cash, and so we have decided to be sen-sible and not go to more expense farther away from home, but to go where Daddy and I both may benefit the most at least expense. 
Daddy's friend Rollie Ley in Wayne told him about Exselsior Springs, Mo, a watering resort that shoudl help Daddy get cleaned out and that may benefit him a lot phy-sically (as well as myself) So we are going to leave here Monday afternoon, and you may send our mail to: Exselsior Springs Mo. Gen. Del, right after receiving this letter. It has been nice here, and it will </p>

<fw type="curatorial">47</fw>
<p>be pleasant to go some where else also. 
I am grateful to you children one and all for htis fine vacation, which I am greatly enjoying. 
Daddy bought me a linen suit here and I had it altered to fit. When I gave my name the sweet young blonde said "That name sounds familiar from Highschool" She was delighted to meet the Pack's wife. It is so lovely to find how many people know Daddy!-
Alice dear, are you watering the ferns in the front room, and are there any buds on our ^water lilies, or any leaves on the Lotus? How many zinnias are blooming? Have you been and to see aobut eh Guinnies"? 
Hilda darling, I am anxious to hear about your dresses...! Did you like the clipps, and was the buckle</p>

<p>too small? 
Enid girlie, please do this, as Daddy and I both are asking you to - write to Mrs Conn, thank her for the interest she has been taking in you, and send her Mr Rosston's recommendations telling her that you thought it might be of help to her. Ask her if you should apply in a </p>

<fw type="curatorial">49</fw>
<p>formal way for ^either or both of the secretarial positions of which she spoke ^to me, or if there is any other way in which you might assist her efforts in your behalf. Please do this darling. 
We are so delighted about Mr Rosston's letter to you - although we fully expected him to appre-ciate you. 
This is all for today - </p>

<salute>Loads of Love to you and all the others - Why does Max not write? nor Sigurd? ?</salute>
