Dear Enat:
<p>I've just made a new ring for you. It's very ugly! This time you need have no fear anything will happen.</p>
<p>Change of temperature will not matter. It will stand anything but walking on, hammering and the like. I wouldn't wash clothes on dishes while wearing it. But otherwise, you can wear it just like any ring.</p>
<p>But you won't want to wear it much; it's really quite ugly.</p>
<p>Sig and I are off to Aberdeen, S.D., etc Sunday A.M.</p>
Love to both
Dad.
