Monday morn.
Dearest Daddy &amp; Mama!
<p>Thanks for your good letters. That is <strike/> nice about the ring - but I don't feel we should accept it for only $150. We planned to pay you more on it when we could.</p>
<p>I'll be very busy between now and Saturday - I only hope I can get every thing done! I shall probably leave here late Saturday night.</p>
<p>We thanked garden at Enid's and Ollie<strike>'s</strike> yesterday!</p>
<p>ruth Hornby's mother gave <underline>me</underline> a surprise shower Sat. afternoon. I got so many lovely things!</p>
<p>It is <unclear/> here - How I hope the 18th will be fair and warm!</p>
Endless love, 
Hilda
