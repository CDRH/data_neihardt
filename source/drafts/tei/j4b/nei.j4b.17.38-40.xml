THE ORDER OF BOOKFELLOWS
Dear Ollie:
<p>Please give me the dimensions of your table top by return mail, and tell me again how long the legs should be.</p>
<p>I have the impression that you are putting sloping sides on the top, like this: <figure type="hand drawing"/> top sides</p>
<p>Is this correct? If so, what is the width of the side pieces? And what is the length of the vertical dotted line above?</p>
<p>If the top stuff is warped, could it be soaked &amp; placed under heavy weight for straightening?</p>
<p>In this case, it's the top that the table is being made for, because of its family associations. The legs are just necessary business! They're beng sawed out now, &amp; I want to bring</p>
40
<p>the fastening along, so that you have only the top to do.</p>
Love to both
Dad
