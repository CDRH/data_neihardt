Dear Ollie &amp; Enat:
<p>The Buddha arrived in fine condition, and I have a pretty pearl to put in his hands - the Pearl of great Price - the Peace that Passeth Understanding. But until I know what ransom you paid, I can't go ahead with my original plan.</p>
<p>Everything goes finely here.</p>
Love for both always,
<underline>Dad</underline>
<p>P.S. The pearl is genuine.</p>
