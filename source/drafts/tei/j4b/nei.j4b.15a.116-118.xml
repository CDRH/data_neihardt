Dear Girl:
<p>We stayed here last night, 17 miles from Ada, as there's no place to stay over there. We'll finish there at 2:30 P.M., and then hurry on to DeKalb, Ill - then the long jump to Evansville - then 3 wks. at Knox.</p>
<p>I awoke this morning thinking of Hiddy and the letters you sent me some while ago. When you're with her you may find a way to balance her a bit more. It saddened me to read of her admiration for Amama's "high-headedness". Poor little girl! She should be led to know, without being wounded, that she honors the very outward symbol of Amama's disaster-bearing character. Can it be that Hiddy does not know</p>

<p>Amama's record, and how she has spread ruin behind her throughout her life, coming a bitter and pitiful old age? She <underline>should</underline> know. I don't want Hiddy, fine as she is, to develop that absurd characteristic. It is precisely <underline>real</underline> gifts that do <underline>not</underline> result in being absurdly up-stage, or even proud.</p>
Love to all of you.
