<p>Just rec'd your letter and Hilda's, and am so glad for both. I can't see anything for you to worry about, Mona. Everything is really all right, and the future looks anything but gloomy.</p>
<p>Hiddy, old girl, this letter is for you too, but I'll write you later. I'm one of your fans.</p>

Endless love
