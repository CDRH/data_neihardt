Dear Enot and Ollie:
A bully joint letter from you! I suspect you were a lot thoughter than you drunk you were on New Year's night; but you can tell Papa anything, and he'll understand.. 
I'm fairly surging along with old Jed - 8, 10, 14 lines a day, and no compromises. I'm often surprised at what I find along the hood; for, although I know where the road rims and all of its hands, I don't know what's around the next bend in the way of enriching detail. Jed's character is growing rapidly for the reader - every mental, spiritual and physical phaze of it - and yet there's no mere telling; you just overhear three guys gassing and getting tighter slowly, and the three are so many steps on the way up to the final revelation of the essential Jed. This method allows a lightness of touch that is often for more effective than any <del/> <unclear/>

admitted seriousness^could be; and poetry breaks through between the common words - that very seldom exceed two syllables. 
I'm much pleased, Oddie, with what you say about the protests, Pulitzer, Reese, and good old sister Fay.  (Our love to her - Mona's and <unclear/>!) 
They did me an excellent turn when they dropped me just then, for they forced me into Jed Smith. Nevertheless, I'm well under way now, and if they should decide to talk with me, I'd have a proposition to make which would involve Enot, if she could be interested. I'd enjoy editing, & <unclear/> from here, and Enot knows the office stuff as well as I do. Her pay would, of course, be boosted. You see, I"m with Jed only tell noon. Afternoons I'd edit and make jewelry. Could manage occasional lecture trips too. Soon I'll be at the amethyst ring again, as my outfit will soon be assembled completely. I'll have the gold today. 
Endless love, 
Dad

This is none of your damn business! I was figurin' revolutions of wheels and surface feet per minute.
