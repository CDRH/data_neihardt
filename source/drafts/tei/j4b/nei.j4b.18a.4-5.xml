Dearest Enid and Ollie:
<p>Amama is planning on leaving the 5th of September, so we think we will then come back up to you. We are so happy to be seeing you all then if nothing unforeseen happens. We have not heard definitely from Kemper yet.</p>
<p>We have had a wonderful time here, and I am very grateful for this experience.</p>
<p>Tell my baby boy that Nanny is eager to see him and that she cannot believe he already talks so much! Soon I want to make his</p>
5
<p>little coat etc and maybe my work can be my birthday gift for him? I do not have anything here good enough. I'd so love to buy the materials but cannot, as we are trying to have what we'll have to have for the housepayment in Sept. SO I'll have to deny myself the pleasure of buying the materials. I'll need 2 (3/4) yards of 36 inch material or 1(7/8) yards of 54 inch material. If you want I can get lovely corduroys at Sars Roe brick for <underline>89</underline> cents a yard of 36 inches width. Let me Know - otherwise I'll wait for you to send me the goods - But please be quick so that I can have the outfit made for our baby's birthday.</p>
<p>We received your dear letters, and are so happy because you are so all round fine -</p>
Your devoted 
Mom - Mother
