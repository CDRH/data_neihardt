Dearest Mom &amp; Dad:-
<p>Am sending teeth at once. Know you need them badly. Too bad.</p>
<p>Mom, Hil is okay. she &amp; Albert were out yesterday. Said she was fine! And she looked it, so don't worry!</p>
<p>Ol was tickled over the telegram!</p>
<p>Dad don't look any more. The Gregg Dict. was really all I wanted! Thanks a lot for all yours &amp; Mom's trouble!</p>
<p>No news.</p>
<p>Ol's picking more blackberries this a.m. I'm sure he'll be able to get you some pictures of Moe Arthur, Mom. He'll attend to that right away. You'll hear son.</p>
Loads o' love, always
Enot
