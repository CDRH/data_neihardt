Warrensburg Tues. Eve
Dearest Ones:
<p>I'm through here. Very good lunch. The last affair ended as a sort of affectionate affair. The thing I expect. We will spend the evening until 9:30 at Diemer's home with a group of friends, then drive on to Marshal &amp; spend the night. Stayed at Diemer's last night. Dear people.</p>
<p>We may spend all of Saturday in St Louis so that Sig can get a good looking over. Mona, we must get after your teeth soon. Do take care of yourself, &amp; take the iron tablets regularly. I'll bet Jaine is a bad girl. I best she is <underline>not</underline>. The idea! Joan is a lovely lady, I'm sure. Kisses to them. Also to you</p>
Jno. Dad.
