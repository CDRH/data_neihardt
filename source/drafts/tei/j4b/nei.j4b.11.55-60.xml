<salute>Dearest Enat:</salute>

<p>Grandma went away at noon today. I was out at Blair, Neb., talking to a state school convention when she died, &amp; the wire reached me a half hour later when I was at lunch. At first I planned to leave at once for Branson, but a second wire asked me to meet Aunty Lu <del>and</del> &amp; at K.C. where the body will be cremated: Before I left Branson I made all arrangements with Whelchel for this - at Grandma's request. So it is best for me to meet Aunty Lu at K.C. instead of going ot Branson first, where I could do no good at all, as all was arranged there.</p>

<p>When I reached the city, the papers had the news of Grandma's death on the front page. Strange! All the Profs., many students and even the hotel people knew &amp; were like brothers. Enat, people are good deep down outside - very good, that's the human truth. If they seem otherwise, it is because of some pathetic misunderstanding of some sort. 
I shoudl be talking to a class in philosophy tonight - a picked group - but they let me off. I didn't ask to be let off. I could have talked well. I know Grandma is all right, &amp; she should know that I know</p>

<p>Listen, Enot, old Lady! here is something for you. This evening Dr. Thompson, Dean of men at the U. of Omaha &amp; my very old friend (we were together in our 20's) insisted on taking me to a show. He thought I'd better not sit around. He is a psychologist, &amp; he understands. Well, just a half hour ago he said! "This daughter of yours in New York - does she want to stay there? "I said no, not necessarily. he then said he thought he'd be needing a secretary next year, &amp; would be glad I have my daughter. This </p>

<p>is in addition to the Presidents need of a Secretary next year. So, Enot, you are now going to school in New York, getting prestige &amp; training for a good job out here. See? By gosh, <del>a</del> I'll land you a job here. The whole school is strange for your Dad, Enot. In spite of Grandma's going, your life is a happy one even now. Grandma was ripe fruit, <del/> and it is good to go when ripe. 
Feel hopeful &amp; eager to learn, old Lady! The outlook is fine for you. 
I rec'd Amama's dear dear letter - good, great, </p>

<p>gray pussy cat as she calls herself, I heard &amp; felt her purr 1500 miles away, &amp; was glad you are lucky, Enot, to have her, as of course you know as well as I do - or better. No more now - but endless love. 
Dad. 
Later 
Have just seen Dr. Thompson again. He has spoken to Dr. Sealock of you. Sealock was interested &amp; sympathetic &amp; said "I think we can do that <del/> a little later on". he is strong format a wonderful man. </p>
