Enid Darling:
<p>It makes me so happy that you and Ollie are enjoying the things we were able to give you. I Know you'll make them look their best possible, and am looking forward eagerly to our next visit to your sweet Home. Too back the dresser is so huge. I really want it bad here so may be we can bring the mirror back in May and the rest could be packed in cardboard and sent here by Phillips Co Truck. There is no hurry. Yes, use the Horine bowl, and place the jonquil bulb in your garden.</p>
Loads of Love
Mother - Mama.
