Dearest Daddy &amp; Mama:
<p>Could not Maxie act as the fourth girl? I believe it is all right, and I know she would <underline>like</underline> to. If you think it would not do for Max to take that part, then Frankie should be asked.</p>
<p>(I wish I could <underline>always</underline> be "characteristic of" myself!)</p>
<p>Are you writing to Dr. Plank directly, writing them to stay there? I imagine you will do that. His adress is <underline>5249 Raymond Ave</underline>.</p>
<p>Should I have a train or just a long dress? Please say what you think.</p>
Endless love as ever,
Hilda
