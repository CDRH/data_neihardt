Dearest Enid:
The letter you wrote the 18th ar-rived here later than the one dated 19th! So that explains why you said nothing about Sigurd's home coming till last night when we received the letter you first wrote, but which for some reason did not get to Wayne on time! Queer, not? 
We are hearing

here tomorrow morning, and we have been having a splendid time! Daddy gave the last of a large number of talks in honor of Dr Conn's Silver Jubilee - and he gave it ^ending in the form of an Indian Prayer - It was the most beauti ful thing I ever listened to and everyone felt the wonder and the power and the deep, earnest sincerity of him, and the miracle of wards that coudl say so much in so short a time. It was grand.

The Governor was, after all not able to be here as the recent strike in Omaha which he had bought ot an end, needed his presence again, and after starting for Wayne he was re-called.-This means that we did not meet Mr Mac-Keechan. However Mrs Conn is going to write.

Uncle Charlie and Aunt Martha were here, both of them so nice and glad to see us. Uncle Charles said to be sure and have you know that be and Martha want you to come straight to thema nd stay till you were good and ready to settle yourself in Lincoln, if you should receive this job. so you see Enid, your life is turning out most interesting, not? 
Mrs Conn said again yesterday, that it would be so lovely for you to be here with Hilda - and of course I did not disagree. Loads of Love <unclear/> Enid 
from Mother.

I simply love and admire Miss Schemel. She is truly beautiful and fine clear through.

Dearest Hilda: 
Everyone here is so glad to meet your Mother, and it has been a real pleasure to see the people you are associating with. I'll not feel as though you were so very far away next year. Your galoshes are here, and we will leave them for you.

They are so delighted with my plan to make a bust of him, for the students to give to the college and for you to unveil, and he a permanent addition to Neihardt Hall, which is, they tell me, Dr Conn's favorite Bldg, and the one which worked out just as he wanted it to do. 
So, when I will have fin-ished Dr Good, I'll go right af-ter Dr Conn's portrait bust. that should be next Winter. When the clay model is done Ardith will come down to us, or maybe Dr and Mrs Conn will
