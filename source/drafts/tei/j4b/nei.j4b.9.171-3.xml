shall like mine /would be incessantly - so which you coem down next summer, we will sit in my upholstered swing beside my fish pool and rock garden, - please don't make any other plans unless your mother needs you we will just go every where, John has a car and both Enid and Sigurd drive.- When John is in Wayne I can hardly wait to ahve him tell me all about you. He always ^says this "she is just as she always was a real lady"-He thinks I ought to know the rest but woman like, I want detail and John is not good on detail unless he is writing in a book. Dear girl I don't feel well enough to write letters and you know without me telling you that I love you and always wish you will 
Many thanks for the beautiful - shall when you see me in my pale blue linen dress and my white shawl and white hair you will not think I looke so bad, I will surely try to write you a decent letter soon. Had a card from Mrs. Preston - lovingly
