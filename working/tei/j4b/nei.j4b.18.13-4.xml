Dear Ollie!
<p>Thanks for the information. No hubbud at all - <underline>letters</underline> just make it seem so. Had we merely talked about it, there would not have been so much seeming circumstanbiality. I had hoped to be able to bring a whole system of conventional fastening for the legs; but I'm afraid this wouldn't fit your plan' so I'll bring the legs nicely tapered &amp; smoothed. The fastening can be done with glued blocks, I think. Yes, walnut is darling stuff. I love the feel of it too; but I'm all for work in very hard materials now, I mean crystals, of course.</p>
<p>We've done very well so far with the books. I've received $200, and another check for $100 is due now. I have not yet even offered the very considerable collection of rare Western items, from which I expected most of the swag. Am just now ready to offer them to Chicago firm I know. the N.Y. outfit doesn't deal in Western Americana. So we should do very well before I'm through selling. And after the Western stuff, there's quite a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>There's something silly about the rare book game. For instance, one of my Frost items was valuable becuase of a printer's error. Another book is valuable because, in teh dedication to Edith <underline>Carow</underline> Roosevelt, the middle name is spelled "Karow." Piffle!</p>
<p>"I got <sic>sumpin</sic> you ain't got!" That's what makes rare volumes sell.</p>
<p>Fine findings &amp; beautiful editions <underline>should</underline> bring a premium. I'm all for that.</p>
Love
Dad
