Dear Ollie:
<p>Thanks fo the information. No <sic>hubbud</sic> at all - letters just make it seem so. Had we merely <underline>talked</underline> about it, there would not have been so much seeming circumstantiality.</p>
<p>I had hoped to be able to bring a whole system of conventional fastening for the legs; but I'm afraid thsi wouldn't fit your plan; so I'll bring the legs nicely tapered and smoothed. The fastening can be done with glued blocks, I think. Yes, walnut is darling stuff. I have the feel of it too, but I'm all for work in very had materials now. I mean crystls, of course.</p>
<p>We've done very well so far with the books. I've received $200, and another check for $100 is due now. I have not yet even offerec the very considerable collection of rare Western items, from which I expected most of</p>
43
<p>the <unclear>sway.</unclear> Am just now ready to offer them to a Chicago firm I know. The N.Y. outfit doesn't deal in Western Americana. So we should do very well before I'm through selling. And after the Western stuff, there's quite a bunch of other things.</p>
<p>There's something silly about the rare book game. For instance, one of my Frost items was valuable because of a printer's error. Antoher book is valuable because in the dedication to Edith <underline>Carew</underline> Roosevelt, the middle name is spelled "Karow". <isc>Piffle</isc>!</p>
<p>"I got sumpin you ain't got!" That's what makes rare volumes sell.</p>
<p>Fine findings &amp; beautiful editions <underline>should</underline> bring a freemium. I'm all for that.</p>
Love Dad.
