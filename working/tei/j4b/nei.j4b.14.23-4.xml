Dear Ollie: 
Damned good - and characteristic - of you to get the copied article to me so quickly! Many Thanks. 
No doubt you've seen Sig and the lovely gals. 
Everything is fine here. Even the sinister 13th of the month tried to bite us, but muffed it. The gods know our faces, and may they never forget! 
Nothing happens here, but you and Enot are always half present with us all. 
But the amount of that ransom - ? 
Affectionately always, 
Dad.
