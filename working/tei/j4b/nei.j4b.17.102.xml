Dearest Children:
<p>I have been thinking of you a lot. Did your Mother come? Please give her my love. - You must have been quite busy doing the things you had planned. I have not yet planted my flower seeds - I did it too early last year so I want to be on the safe side this year. The place is gorgeous with blooms now. Hope it does not freeze. Daddy is writing a lot every morning on Jed. We all are happy and well. The Wubs are <underline>so</underline> happy out doors. Joanie lost her first tooth!</p>
<p>Write Please to your loving and devoted</p>
Mother Mama
