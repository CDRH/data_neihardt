Dearest Children
<p>it was great to hear all about your lovely Xmas together adn I am so glad the telegram got to you. Daddy came near sending you a long sentimental telegram all about the little Christ child, but he did not do so thinking I'd not like it! However for hours after words Daddy would all of a sudden break out and laugh, picturing to himself how Ollie would have almost died laughing over such a Xmas message from <underline>him</underline> of all people!! We in no manner shape or form celebrate the coming of Good Will on Earth -- but it makes us very happy to know that you dear children had a perfect Xmas. Such loving times together with the true Xmas feeling are one of the good thigns of this life.</p>
<p>I am so delighted that you have a lovely house-coat, Enid darling, from that best of men who is your dear husband - and a dresser set too how wonderful!! Tell me what color it is, or does it match your bedroom? Hilda and Alice both wrote how wonderful Xmas was at your home. It is lovely that you will have your table cloth ready for the 16th - I have often thought of you working of it. - Tomorrow I am going to really get to work on all the painting I must do to fill the orders </p>

<p>Amama gave me. I must not go back on my word, and having taken the money, I must do as good a job as I possibly can.-</p>
<p>Daddy thinks he will get a few lines tomorrow - I do so hope he will.</p>
<p>This is not much of a letter but I'd be glad if you and Alice would share my other letters with Hilda as it is hard to repeat.</p>
<p>I can never, never be grateful enough for Daddy, and for you dear, good children one and all -</p>
Loving you endlessly
your devoted old
Mama
