Wed. afternoon
Dearest Mama and Daddy!!
<p>Thanks for your letter, Mama. The dress is not only "warm and serviceable" - wait until you see it on me. I wore it to the opera Monday. Albert liked it. We happened to see Mrs. Stoker there and she <underline>said it was</underline> lovely! Sig can't help it that he has to be on the floor unexpectedly. We practiced awhile yesterday. Last Sunday Albert and I went to the Musical Arts <unclear/>. And I sang for <strike>an</strike> a man there who is arranging programs. He wants Sig &amp; me to come one eve. this week. It may be nothing, but we'll see.</p>
<p><underline>I am going to sing</underline> very soon for Mrs. Stoker.</p>
<p>Will try to come home - I don't know about Sig &amp; Max. <underline>If</underline> they don't (can't) come, <underline>could we bring Millie</underline>?</p>
Unending devotion to you both -
Hilda
<p>Alice's dress is perfect.</p>
