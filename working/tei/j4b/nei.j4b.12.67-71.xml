Dearest Girlie:
Mrs Wilson will do your quilt. It will cost you for wishing about 6 dollars. If you want it made standard size however you could let her add a white border strip in between the wide blue border you now have like this = <figure/> - then line the whole thing with white, and scallope the edge. She thinks a white shreud used would be prettier than blue and a white lining

nicer than blue. I can buy the white material here if you decide on white. But if you want blue you'll have to buy it in St Louis. I'm sending you a sample of the blue in case you want that. She wants to quilt around your em-broidered flower designs, and then make a similar de sign on the plain squares with the quilting stitches Let me know at once and she'll have it well star

ted for you to see if you come down in about 2 weeks or so. Hilda is coming home for one week - and am I hap-py!!! She says she has been working a lot extra and is coming! Isn't it grand? 
I'm so surprised at what you say about Nelson - I'm sure if I were you I'd go up in smoke! Maybe not! 
I'll write Mrs S and

let her do the suggesting she will! 
I am so eager to get well I need to do so many things it makes me wretched to have to be this way. 
Loads of love
from Mama.
