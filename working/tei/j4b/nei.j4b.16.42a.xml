Dearest Mom-
<p>So happy about the possibility of your Camlen Camark Potter work. Only, after reading the letter, I'd want to be surer that they aren't hoping to make money off of <underline>you</underline>, before you go to see them. Wouldn't it be great to be able to make some money off of them! I know just how you'd feel! Ol &amp; I are holding thumbs with regard to the thing you may be sure!! What does Dad think of the outfit?</p>
<p>I shall mail it to Hil (the Carmen letter) with the request that she send it on to you. I'm going to talk to her this a.m.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I am expecting the "curse" again. I dread them! The last was so hard a plow. Maybe this won't be so bad!</p>
<p>I'm going to have Al get me a pattern for baby jackets, etc. so I can get going on that wool.</p>
<p>Ol thinks we'll have a girl this time! Nobody knows.</p>
Loads o' love,
Enid
<p><underline>P.S.</underline>
Let us know all about what comes of the pottery business. -E-&amp;O-</p>
