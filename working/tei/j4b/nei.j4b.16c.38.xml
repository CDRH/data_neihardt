Dearest Mutti!
<p>I have looked in 5 places for the decoration you need for your hat, and the best I could find I have mailed you today. There were some lovely birdie, etc. in <underline>colors</underline>, but this is all I could find in White. I hope it will be what you want!!</p>
<p>I do want you and Waddy to have a lovely trip and a good time. Please let me know where I can write you. I hear we have letters at home - I am eager to read them.</p>
<underline>Endless love and devotion</underline>
to you both form your
very busy daughter,
<underline>Hilda</underline>
