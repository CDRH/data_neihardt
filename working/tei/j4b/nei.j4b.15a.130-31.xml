Tuesday Morning
Precious Mona:
<p>I've just received your letter with Sig's, and I can tell you I was mightly glad you it. Of <underline>course</underline> you must go ahead at once with your teeth. Sig and I talked about that several times on the trip. It's a pity that we've let it go so long. I see no reason why we can't take care of the expense; and if we couldn't, Hiddy's offer could be accepted as a loan. In any case the teeth <underline>must</underline> be fixed now.</p>
<p>I'm almost certain now that no kitchenette apartment can be had here for so short a period. At the beginning of winter they want tenants who will stay; and, anyway, the choice of places is very vey limited. but, if things go well here, I'll want you to come up and be with me.</p>
