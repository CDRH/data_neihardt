Dear Enid & Ollie:
Too bad about the Traver feases! Evidently it was a shoddy business. I've seen them like that; but the experience really isn't typical of the sort of thing that has interested me. Even at their best, they are of no help whatever, since nothing they predict can be accepted until it happens. But I've had adventures with them that were like entering another world, and I've felt refreshed as a result. Occasionally that happens with Mrs. Boyles. But there is bound to be a vast amount of blundering guesses and cheap faking. Yes, I too prefer the power we call Black Elk's and I depend upon it. Incidentally, "coincidences" still appear with striking punctuality. That pasture of ours is a wonderful place to go to, and I'm haivng it turned into a lovely little grove. 
Enot, I too feel as you do about not making any more pages together; but I have no doubt "the best is yet to come." I suspect that we're destined to be a tight little group, and I'm might glad old Ollie is in it.

The new Deal played is a scream! I showed it to Mama, and she chuckled so much that Max took it away from her & read it herself. Last night Max made a copy of it for Marie. 
You bet I want you to copy Jed when it's ready, Enot! 
Sig is on his way, toward St. Louis, and will arrive about Friday - probably in the evening. You'll no doubt all get together. 
Wonderful weather here - a golden, never-forever stillness - everything listening. 
I love you both as onex
Dad. 
I want to know what you paid for the god - please. It will arrive today, I suppose.
