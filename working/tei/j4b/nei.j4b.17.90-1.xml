Wednesday afternoon
Dearest Daddy and Mama!
<p>Many thanks, Mama, for your very dear and so welcome letter! It was a nice bright <unclear>sort</unclear> for me when I cam to the office thsi morning.</p>
<p>That was surely strange about the person you saw walking in the garden. The whole place must be "haunted".</p>
<p>If you are going to Gillispie's, I imagine you will not be home this week-end. Sigurd mentioned going down home again. However, I do not know it we shoudl go. I spoke to Sig a few minutes this morning, but only about a 5rm./<unclear/> in the <unclear/> which is being completely repainted inside and out and will rent you $25. He seemed interested and is going to see about it today.</p>
<p>Every once in awhile I remember some little thing one of you said or some little characteristic move you made - you are the dearest people I ever could imagine.</p>
<p>We are going to our dancing lesson this evening. I hope to practice with Sig tomorrow eveing.</p>
Endess love as always,
Hilda
