Dearest Enid:
<p>Your sweet letter with the seeds made me once again as grateful for <underline>you</underline>. It is just like you to send exactly the brand of nasturtiums I lost - <underline>how</underline> could you Know? The Heavenly blue morning glories also I had not replaced - but everything else Daddy had gotten for me again - and more - so this place should be very beautiful this year! I hope it may be so and that we will get at least $5000.00 for it before Fall. - This note may not reach you before Daddy, Sig, and Max do - but I wanted to say</p>
26
<p>a word to you as well. I am going to have one swell time with Joan and Elaine - we are going to do everything together - play "Keep house" together - and it will be a time of rest for me. Joan says Nannie is not a grown-up - so may be that accounts for our good time. I don't want Max to feel hurried to get back and I Know she will not worry.</p>
<p>She deserves a good time and I am glad she can be with you and the girls a bit. Daddy wants to see Mr <unclear>Bonard</unclear> - I do hope he can get around to it.</p>
<p>Jed Smith is <underline>so</underline> wonderful but has to wait again - Nobody Knows what</p>
27
<p>it has meant to get a great work written all the heartache it takes and all the difficulties - but I believe we can see the end this Fall - and after that there will have to be something else for Daddy but no more long Poems. -</p>
Love in endless streams to
my Enid and her Man
from Mama - Mother.
