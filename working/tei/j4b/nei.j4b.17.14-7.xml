Enid Darling:
<p>I received your pattern and like it very much. I may get a crepe of some sort for it - a rich deep blue would be my choice, and would not fight your rust when we are together! May start it next week. This week I have my hands full. Painting etc - but it is</p>

<p>such fun!</p>
<p>Joanie had a marvelous birthday, and the best cake I ever made plus the prettiest icing and decorations Max ever made! We had Mom Daisy up for the day. <underline>Please</underline> don't feel you have to spend money for Joan adn Elaine any more. Their Daddy is making good and no longer needs to have</p>
16
<p>help from the rest of us. - <underline>Any</underline> remembrance is plenty.</p>
<p>Your news is of course most welcome to your Mother - that you already Know. You will be married just as long as Daddy and I were before You came. And may he or she be as welcome to both you and Ollie as you were to <underline>your</underline> Daddy and Mama - and may he or she turn</p>

<p>out ot be as great a blessing to you both, as you have always been to us - that is the very best wish I can make you!</p>
<p>God bless my dear girlie, and her Man - and come very soon, and stay longer than a week!</p>
Mama Mother.
