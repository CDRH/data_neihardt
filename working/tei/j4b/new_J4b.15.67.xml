Precious Mona:
<p>I've just rec'd yours telling of Hiddy's sickness, and I'm so sorry! It does seem you know when to go there, and I'm glad you've been on hand to see the girls through. Of course I want you to be there as long as you're needed, much as I and the rest want you here. We were giving the whole place the twice over for your return when your letter came. The lawn is nearly mowed, I'll finish this afternoon, and I have a young fellow preparing the flower gardens. Also, I have to look into the drain again.</p>
<p>Here's a bushel of love for old lady Hiddy! Do Hitler and Mussolini give <underline>all</underline> diplomats a pain in the neck?!</p>
<p>Incidentally, isn't it refreshing to see France &amp; England guessing the way they are now? All the nations are without couscience and brutal; but two actualyy! Say what they mean for once!</p>
<p>Come as soon as you can. We love you.</p>
Jno. Dad

<p>I've just finished a really beautiful thing, and now I do fell "Jeddy" again!</p>
<p>Hurrah for old lady Alice back at school!</p>
