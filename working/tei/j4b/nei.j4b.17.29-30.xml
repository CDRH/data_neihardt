Dear Ollie &amp; Enat:
<p>You really shouldn't have, but I'm glad you did, because I do like nice mufflers. ANd the kimona for the Ceremonial Knife is a dandy! Numerous thanks! Bless you both!</p>
<p>Maybe we can't get away until about Feb 1. I'd like it if we could stay until spring shows up.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure you didn't misinterpret my former letter about the proposed visit. We're eager to come &amp; look at you.</p>
<p>Don't teeter that basket Enot Peanot! We want to hug that Wub and make it bawl.</p>
Endless love
Dad.
