Dearest Mom &amp; Dad:-
<p>My, <underline>what service</underline>! Thanks <underline>so very</underline> much for going thru all that search (I know what it is!!) to find the books! I know Sue will be happy! I'll tell her about how you hunted for them for her! I'm happy we can help her out with a few Gregg books - they're so expensive to buy!! Aren't you?</p>
<p>What kind of jelly are you making Mom? I'll bet it's swell! I've been doing that too. Am going to can mroe tomatoes tomorrow &amp; am soon going to make elderberry-wild cherry jelly! Mother Fink says it's good! Tho't I'd try it.</p>
<p>Nei's so adorable - one can hardly believe he's a baby, yet he's so cuddly too! He's <underline>entirely too intelligent</underline> for 11 mos.!</p>
<p>Will write soon! We're looking forward to your coming back to be with us - all three of us are. Love to Amama. We're happy she's feeling better.</p>
Loads o' love,
Enot
