Jackson, Miss, Monday.

Lovely Mrs. Brown:
<p>So I thought I'd write you another letter. Do you still have the same cat? Did you like your picture? How is your Nanny? How is your Mama? How is your tiny sister? And Mrs. Mulevy-? I do hope she and the children are all well. I am vey fat and hope you are the same. There are lots of little girls and boys here, and some of them are black all over. There are mocking birds, too; and they sing all night long and all day long. Kiss your little sister and yourself for <underline>Grandan</underline>.</p>
