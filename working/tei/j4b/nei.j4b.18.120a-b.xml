Dear Dad &amp; Mom:
<p>I've thought of you so often, but I just never get down to business on letter writing. There is nothing new, expcepting that I've begun the good old extensive hours at the piano again. I use the Musical Arts Bldg. studio.</p>
<p>Seems strange that Corpus Christi has not yet materialized. There is one more place in St. L. where I may have a chance to get a war job, the Amertorp Co., makers of torpedoes. I'll see them first of wk. or before.</p>
<p>If nothing else turns up, I plan to go to Chicago for 3 days early in Aug., (my vacation will be 10 days) and play for some agencies just to stisfy my curiousity as to possible opportunities in that field. How I do wish I were teaching. There should be some way, &amp; I'm looking for one.</p>
<p>I am at the store all day today. Business is a bit stagnant.</p>
<p>Have you heard from Boonville yet? I hope that works out, or possibly Culver.</p>
Loads of love for you both &amp; for Amama,
Sig &amp; family.
