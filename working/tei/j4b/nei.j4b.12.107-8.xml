Darling Joanie!
So youa nd your Granny just have six teeth! I think we should celebrate together! Do you know I also have a sort of go-cart, but mine is called a "wheel barrow" by these queer grown ups!

Aunt Alice feels so im-portant pushing me into the Garden up to the pool where the little goldfish are. and Aunt Hilda laughs at us till she holds her sides, She says Granny looks "cute" and that we are "funny". But you and I won't care, will we?! Tell Mama to kiss you six times for your own Granny.
