Dear Daddy and Mama,
<p>By this time you must have received my letter from Kasson. I just received your letter this morning in Prestion, before we left for Cresco, fifty (36) miles distance. We now have rooms in a nice home here, and are sitting in a drug store after eating lunch.</p>
<p>The day is beautiful - blue sky, crisp golden air, and white clouds. The flowers are gorgeous.</p>
<p>We had a grand time in Preston. Our audiences were large and enthusiatstic and the weather was marvelous. The second</p>

<p>night I did all four numbers - our Russian and the other three numbers with the line, and have done so ever since. that stage is <underline>so</underline> large and it is a real <underline>thrill</underline> dancing on it out under the glorious open sky. Our conductor is a real musican and does all he can for us too. We are getting things down pat! We rehearsed on the stage and really worked hard.</p>
<p>George and the Conductor are working together on my waltz to be! They're doing a special arrangement of the two French waltzes</p>

<p>I told you about. I am <underline>so</underline> eager to work it up now. We are working on "la priccia Espagnol" too.</p>
<p>Please write me here. We leave Thursday. Will write later all about our doings.</p>
<p>Sorry Amama is leaving now. I do <underline>so</underline> wish the best for her.</p>
<p>So you <underline>are</underline> going to Eny's and Ollie's! Grand for them and I know you'll enjoy yourselves too.</p>
Loads of Love
Your Alice
