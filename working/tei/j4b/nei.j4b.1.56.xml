Dear Folks:- 
Got here at 1 o'clock today & will stay until 9:50 tomorrow (Wednesday) evening. Grace & Jess both Cook mighty well & their home is mighty nice right now with a fine prospect of being very much nice soon. 
Tonight they are going to take me to the <unclear/> vanderville. I'll talk about them when I get home. Had a rough sea trip-stormy. I still feel <unclear/> sea heaving under me, tho' I wasn't violently sick.
