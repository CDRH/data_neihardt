Dearest Children:
<p>If Alice Knew how homesick I get for her - maybe she would not be so unKind as to write so seldom - Her last letter was dated Dec. 29th and I am still rereading it every otherday or so like a famished dog gnawing at the same old dried up bone - Maybe this sounds exeggerated but it <underline>is not</underline>.</p>
<p>Enid darlign, Hilda says you are better and look so well and I am grateful and happy. I am sending you some soft blue wool Amama left - maybe you can turn it into something</p>
42
<p>for that Xmas baby? Of course you are O.K. Enid - and I am anxious to hear what Dr Finley had to say. Please tell me all about it.</p>
<p>I had a letter that encourages me form the Camark Pottery - man- I do so hope maybe I'll still have some good luck; when I know definitely I'll tell you.</p>
<p>Tell Ollie I <underline>need</underline> another one of his funny letters - I have not laughed heartily since his last one! However I do want to know lest Alice did not <underline>really</underline> come home drunk at 5 in the morning!</p>
<p>We are all well now and happy together and Dad is getting along well on Jed.</p>
Loads of love always from
Mama Mother.
