my Dear Miss Piper:
This ^is not to be a real letter but just a line to relieve my conscience gracious have I spelled that right I don't believe it Ever looked like that before but amy  you will know what I mean, the lillies have been blooming so beautifully in your little basket and has been such a lovely reminder of the little girl who gave them. I will soon have to empty them out for they are fading now. These beautiful days have put the housekeeping bug in my bonnet and I began on my pictures, your photo is now framed and hanging beside my bed, and it looks as tho you were very saitsfied to be there this morning tho, my ardor is dampered and things are just resting, as we are having a snow storm and we can't blame it onto Iowa & Nebr. as it is

coming frmo the smith, I was so glad to hear about your work and I think you wise in making the change, you won't have so much vacation but you will have other compensations, one of them is you are at home and I'm sure your father and mother are glad. Oh dear it is just dreadful when ones family all take it into their heads to to go away, just now I am in a quandary I have always been with John or near him, now they must leave here on account of the children's schooling and music, and here I am with every thing I own in a rock house, I just can't be pulling up and transplanting my self Ever few years, I am too old to transplant, and the din from Buffalo Minneapolis and JOhn crying to make me feel I must not stay here-now if I were a profane woman I would say it is a "Hell of a fix to be in", If this I am certain I will be in my own home, I'll work whereever I am and I might as well be working for me as the other fellow every body sends love to you with the big bunch I am sending.
