Darlings all 4!
It is 4, 10 and I am sitting in our car beside a used car Dealer on Troost in Kansas City. Sig and Daddy are look ing at a number of things, among them and Austin, which is ador-able and very economical as a means of transpor tation- It seems it 
costs less to run an Austin than any big car!
We have stopped at a wonderful fruit and vegetable marked and have bought: Beans, onions, cherries, turnips, tomatoes and Beets - all for 75 cts. Will I have fun cook ing these things? 
I love you dear dear kids - Write every little thing you think or do to your old Mother.
