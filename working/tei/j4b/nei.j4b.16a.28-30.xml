Dearest Ones
<p>Before getting lunch I want to say that we are very busy and very happy - I put the "Ad" in the paper - "Modren, Groom Home, beautiful grounds" in the for Sale section. People will be referred to me - and Mr Runyon believes in good results - so here's hoping! I am cleaning the upstairs now after finishing the downstairs. Put the carpet down and made</p>
30
<p>everything look so beautiful! What a lovely place this <underline>is</underline>!</p>
<p>Joan and Elaine found their big balls and are having a swell time with them - We are eating out of doors - </p>
Loads of love to <underline>all</underline> my darlings
from their most grateful and devoted
Mona - Mama - MOther -
