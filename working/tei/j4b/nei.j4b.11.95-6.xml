Dearest Miss Piper:
Mother always loved you dearly and you must know that from the fact that she always wanted you to have her books. I feel 
you will prize them as well as the letters he wrote his mother years ago, which I believe remained in the Bible - or am I mista-ken about your receiving it also? 
I surely hope to see you some time again - and would love to go to Wayne with my husband. 
Cordially Mona Neihardt.
