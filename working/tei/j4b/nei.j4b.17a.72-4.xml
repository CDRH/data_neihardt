Dear Enot and Ollie:
<p>The continuing good news from the New Boy front is always a pleasure to us here. A few nights ago I dreamed of him very vividly. He was sitting up in a most capable manner and smiling - presumably at his Gaki. He was a beautiful little cuss.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to a time when he will take a firm hold on my enormous first finger and toddle with me even to the far end of the pasture.</p>

<p>Mama &amp; I have been manufacturing Ozark babies and Traumereis. They come out beautiful, and the rubber mould's work perfectly. We'll soon be making a mould for the lamp girl. Also, I'm running the jewelry factor part time.</p>
<p>Everyone here is well, including the Doctor. How Nei will like old George!</p>
Love to you Three,
Dad.
