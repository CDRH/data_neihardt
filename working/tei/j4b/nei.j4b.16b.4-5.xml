Dearest Boy:
<p>We are at a homey place in Chambersburg for a week waiting for the 9th at Shippensburg, a town 11 miles East on the Highway - Daddy is writing every morning on Jed. If we could have had a few more engagements, this would have been a profitable trip. As it is it is far better than no trip at all.</p>
<p>We are <underline>so</underline> tickled over your good work and your evident success at the Western Auto Co. It surely is swell, and I am so proud of you, and so grateful for your achievement. Have written Max regarding my fears to - however I hope they are <underline>just fears</underline>, and not re</p>

<p>alities. Any way all we want is for you to make good for your self and for your family.</p>
<p>When we get to St Louis we want to buy an iron at your store, because the one we are now using in Branson is Max's. As for tires, we can get retreads which are just as good as new ones for less money.</p>
<p>I'll be so glad when you are practicing every morning and pushing ahead with some serious big work such as a Symphony Concert. That really is the next important step is it not?</p>
<p>Regards to Mr. Sandage.</p>
Always the same old love for you my only dear, dear boy-
from Mama.
