<p>Dear Sterling: -</p>

	<p>It has been a long while since I heard from you last, but many things have kept me from writing. Your last letter told how you had refused to become a member of the Institute, & I rejoiced at your stand, for your reasons are good. I had thought, however, that the advertising value of membership might be considerable, and for that reason I was genuinely glad to hear that you had been selected. Of course you do not need the Institute; it could add nothing to you, but it makes a noise, & this is a noisy planet.</p>
	<p>Anyway, congratulations on your admirable display of bowels!</p>
	<p>Do you know Dhan Gopal Mukerji, the young Hindoo<sic>Hindu</sic> Brahmin? He spent Easter Sunday with me, and we had a fine battle!</p>
	<p>The school edition of Glass was sold out by Feb 1st, & is only now reprinting. Rather gratifying to me! My "The Splendid Mayfaring" (prose) will be out for the Fall trade. Am beginning on my "Song of the Indian Wars".</p>
	<p>How are you, Old Man? And do you love me just a little? I wish I could have you alone in some lonesome place for a day. So much to discuss concerning current tendencies!</p>
	<p>Good luck!</p>                      <p>(See inside)</p>


		<p>Yours always,</p>

<p>I'm off for a scout on several of the old Sioux & Cheyenne battlefields in May. Will lecture at several places by way of paying expenses. Will meet some Indian-chiefs<sic>Indian chiefs</sic> & scouts who have agreed to give me dope on the old heroic times. They will go to a big ranch out in the sand hills<sic>Sandhills</sic>, & there we will have a powwow.</p>
