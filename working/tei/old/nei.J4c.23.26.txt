<p>Dear Bower:</p>

	<p>Dr. Robinson is changing the date of my talk - probably to Thurs., Feb. 26th. Any time you can let me meet your class will suit me. I'm eager to know some of your students. I've changed my ticket for return from Portland, Sat. morning, the 28th

I'm wondering if I must go up to Portland on Friday. You'll know. It is going to be a joy to see you and Lucile!! Robin, of course, is counting the days.</p>
