Dear Friend:-

	Your visit had the usual good effect. I was doubly a poet yesterday, & finally wrought lines fairly besieged me. I am going to have a wonderful time in describing that superb body of <illegible>. There is something almost intoxicating about the thought of capturing all those lines about it that are after me yet today. You are always an instrument an time when I see you, & that augments whatever music is in me. After you left, I began really to think about Mrs. Sheldon's letter. I couldn't quite see all around it while you were here. And it has come to seem to me that I ought not to accept the $15 offer for an appearance before the Thursday Lecture Circle. The Woman's Club might be all right; would be so, if the women could take me seriously enough to pay as others have & will pay. You see, Doctor, the fact is that to those women I am a sort of local celebrity trying to get on. But I am decidedly not that. Perhaps it would be better to give the women time to learn something about modern American poetry before I go to them. I dislike patronage based on a poor understanding, as this is likely to be.
