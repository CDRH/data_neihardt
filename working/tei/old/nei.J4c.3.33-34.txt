<p>Dear Friend:-</p>

	<p>Mr. Kreider says the week of June 11th suits him; so if you can set a day in that week, I'll go ahead with arrangements for the recital here. Let me know. I'll send you material for an announcement in your papers a little later. It will be a treat for us.</p>
	<p>Your letter was bully, altho' you called it incoherent. I had half a notion to send it to Marsh of Macmillans! By the way, Marsh (the vice-president) writes: "Hugh Glass is getting some really fine reviews, as you see. I have not yet seen the  big arresting review which will give it the place it deserves in American literature, but I still hope someone will do this for us." Now who is going to do it?</p>
	<p>I wrote to Prof. Wilson as you directed. It's good news that he thinks of having me there.</p>
	<p>How goes the book? I'm getting eager. I know it will be worthwhile. Am just putting the finishing touches on my "Lyrics", the next volume. It will contain all my best.</p>
	<p>Do you enjoy doing the "Notes"? I almost love your class for being enthusiastic about "The Song"; but nine-tenths of that is in your presentation, I'm sure.</p>
	<p>Good luck on the book.</p>

	Don't you really want that presidency? If the book goes off well, you will want it.</p>
