<p>Dear Mr. Mott: -</p>

	. . . . . . . . . . 

	<p>It's the best of news that you will write two articles about my work. The more the better: and especially when the work is done by a man of rare understanding. I feel quite safe in your hands, Mott.</p>
	<p>The prospect for the success of the epic cycle is surprisingly good and grows better steadily.</p>
	<p>"The Song of the Indian Wars<sic>Wars"</sic> is going on in a most satisfactory way, and I count it a great privilege to have so tremwndous<sic>tremendous</sic> theme to handle. Four hundred twenty five lines in four months! Two glorious years of work left! It's fine to be alive, have a big job to do, and know how to do it.</p>
	<p>Be sure that I am deeply grateful for your friendship and cooperation.</p>

						<p>Always yours,</p>
