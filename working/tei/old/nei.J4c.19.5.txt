<hi rend="underline">Dear</hi> Seymours:

	<p>Not much to say except what you should already know - that it was great to be with you, bless your good hearts!</p>
	<p>I'm just now beginning to get back into the right world for <hi rend="underline">Jed Smith</hi>, and shall be going ahead soon.</p>
	<p>Of course I'll find a M. S. for you. You must have received the Aulard. And you must have The Divine Enchantment - really rare, because I burned all I could find.</p>
	<p>It's good that you'll see Bacheller. I'll bet he's a dear fellow. That's what matters.</p>
	<p>I'm sincerely interested in <hi rend="underline">The Agent</hi>. What material! And F. W. S. will know how to handle it.</p>
	<p>With thanks and all good thoughts,</p>
                             <signature>Jno. Neihardt</signature>
