<p>Dear Lucile:</p>

	<p>Yes, it  <hi rend="underline">was</hi> truly a lovely week, and <hi rend="underline">is</hi>! If it isn't any more, it never was; and if this happy doctrine is at odds with the universe, then I have no compliments for the Cosmic Plan! (Wow!) I'm betting on a <hi rend="underline">waking Now</hi> that never turns to dream.</p>
	I'm glad to know that some of the fine people I met have said kind things of me what I did. It's good that I did not let you and Bower down. Thanks, thanks for telling me. You speak of "next year" when we

-2-

shall repeat the experience. Next year seems far off, and I like to think that you and Bower will be in the Mid-West<sic>Midwest</sic> during early summer, and that we may be able to explore Bancroft and Wayne. Wouldn't that be fun - for me at least!</p>	
	<p>Hurrah for the Greek project and for those who will share the adventure with you! You make me want to share. I'll look at my old grammar. When I am at Skyrim again, I hope I can get straightened out and feel creative. I want to very much. I've been a bit upset,

-3-

Lucile, and am yet. I like to <hi rend="underline">be</hi> and <hi rend="underline">say</hi> and give the best I've got; and I <hi rend="underline">have</hi> given at every opportunity. But the old drive to "make" - I'll really try, though; really. At any rate "I Shall Be Young with You" should come through. <hi rend="underline">Your wanting me to do these things is a powerful stimulus</hi>.</p>
	<p>On May 2nd Thomas Hart Benton and I are to "discuss modern trends in art" at the Christian College banquet. Of course, I'll not discuss painting, but I can

-4-

say something with meaning about Poetry, Literature in general, the cultural mood. I'm full of that and I know what I know. I've made it clear that there will be <hi rend="underline">no debate</hi>. As friends, we will say what we see and know and feel. There'll be no rancor in my remarks - no hopeless view. They have asked also that I give some of my poetry. I gave lyrics to that crowd of girls twice, and my golly! how<sic>How</sic> they <hi rend="underline">did</hi> respond!</p>

-5-

	<p>Tomorrow (Thurs.) evening I must do a program in the big ballroom at the Student Union. It's a dinner. Hilda will be there with bells on too! Now if I just had you to give the Introduction, Lucile, we'd wreck the joint! But I'm not kidding about your Introductions. They are expert and beautiful - smooth as a bird's wing. <hi rend="underline">And they introduce</hi>. I do love the way you do the job.</p>

	<p>The little box got started your way yesterday. It's from Mona and John to Lucile. I was sorry to note a slight imperfection that wasn't there a year ago. But it is hardly to be noticed. Mona must have dropped the pin. She wore it nearly every day. Irving Dilliard was here the other day for the Journalism School's big international doings. He came to see me, and we

-7-

spent a happy hour-and-a half together remembering old days on the P-D - better P. D. days they were too - and recalling what Geo. S. Johns or O. K. Bovard said! When Dilliard arrived in my office, he said: "John, I want to embrace you!" And I said: "Dilliard, I want to embrace <hi rend="underline">you</hi>. So we hugged each other and when he left, we repeated the operation, good and hard!

-8-

When he came from Harvard to the P-D he wrote for me. I remember telling him one day that he could go about as far as he might want to go. I felt the stuff in him then. He is too big for the present P-D., but he is too wise to be very unhappy.</p>
