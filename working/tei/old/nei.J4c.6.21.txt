<p>Dear Bookfellows: -</p>

	<p>I must thank you for October's bookly joy! It is indeed a joy, and I share Starret's gratitude. If I knew just where to find them, I would gladly collect some 

	" - maiden's hearts and sudden widow's eyes"

to be added to our poet's "thirty sacks".</p>
	<p>Golly! What a line that is! I must know more about Starret.</p>

		<p>Yours,</p>
