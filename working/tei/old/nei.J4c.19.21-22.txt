<p>Dear Friend:</p>

	<p>I've been reading your precious letter of Nov. 27th again. Many, many thanks! It's a dark world, but there is light. It breaks through your letter.</p>
	<p>I'm wondering if I may not see you - and Mrs. Graves - this winter. A Lincoln school man has suggested a tour of Nebraska high schools, and this may work out. He has in mind small fees, consecutive dates, and a plan whereby money may be raised for Red Cross. I'd love that. We'll see.</p>
	<p>Mona has done two beautiful things recently, and I am her caster. We can now cast the most difficult figures.</p>
	<p>Affection from both of us.</p>
