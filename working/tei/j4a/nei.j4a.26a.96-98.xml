                    <salute>Dear Darling Dr. <hi rend="caps">N.</hi>,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>The letters which I have written you the last six months are <unclear>put</unclear> away. To send them or not to send them remained an unanswered question. I always hoped to write you and Mrs. <hi rend="caps">N</hi> so that no suffering, heartbreak or worry would show. I was never able to keep it all out.</p>
                
                <p>Word has come to me that your beloved Mona went on ahead. A mutual friend  came through Providence last week. She was kind enough to stop at the school where I teach. She told me the little she knew.</p>
                
                <p>Well I feel heartbroken about her not being permitted to stay longer with you in her physical presence. I know she is with you in loving care. The two of you remain in my heart &#8212; I have had hopes of getting my books but guess not. My copy of <hi rend="underline">The Cycle of the West</hi> is in Missouri, too.</p>
                
                <pb facs="nei.j4a.26a.96-98_0002"/>
                
                <p>My term paper was on Robe<unclear>rt</unclear> Frost. I spent over 500 hours studying just the poetry of <hi rend="underline">The <unclear>Complete</unclear> Poems</hi>. Very rewarding. I was given a chance to go to Breadloaf for the summer + would have had a chance to have talked with him. (<hi rend="caps">NO MONEY &#8212; C</hi> - <hi rend="underline">keeps everything</hi></p>
                
                <p>You know that if it is possible I hope to be able to write up my notes for <hi rend="underline">The Song of Jed Smith</hi> for you as you requested. Of course my days are as they come &#8212;</p>
                    
                <p>The cruelty and wickedness I endured silently because <hi rend="caps">C</hi>&#8212; could not be appealled to during the 20 years before I tried to get the divorce in <add>early</add> January, 1957 have defied expression. I know only in part what he has done against me since I unsuccessfully tried to get that divorce. A divorce was filed in Circuit Court in <hi rend="underline">June</hi>, 1957. How <hi rend="caps">C</hi>&#8212; can have exacted the influence he did on Probate Court, Circut Court + everything else remains an utterly incomprehensible mystery to me. The seriousness of having had a Sheriff enter my home on false charges, remove me from my home so that for awhile &#8212; until the court record was corrected I was without privileges of citizenship weighs heavily upon me. <del/><add>B</add>ecause <hi rend="caps">C</hi>&#8212; has succeeded in such daringly executed deeds against me and cut me off from credit money etc... friends, relatives

                <p>If you ever have the money please come to see us. Linda, Bobby, and I have some nice rooms now. They <add>L&#8212; + B&#8212;</add> have worked hard + done well in school. The school where I work has been delighted with me as teacher.</p>
                
                <p>Had <hi rend="caps">C</hi>&#8212; + his lawyer Ralph Alexander left me alone here we could have felt more secure + had some reason to be more hopeful.</p>
                
                <p>As it is, we have come through an extraordinarily difficult winter. People back there, or even here, would not believe two children + their Mother could do so well with so little.</p>
                
                <p>But God has blessed us and we are thankful. Strangers have been casually kind and we are grateful for whatever has come our way.</p>
                
                <p>We like this city. The spring weather, the lovely trees and flowers &#8212; well, it is very beautiful. We're thankful to have our new place here at 377 Angell. My gratitude + love for you <del/><add>are</add> too great for my words.</p>
