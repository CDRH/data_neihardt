Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>We wish to thank you very much for the personally autographed books which you sent. We consider ourselves to be fortunate indeed to be the recipients of the treasured volumes.  We aremost grateful for your thoughtfulness and we are honored to be worthy of these fine books.</p>
<p>In all the years I have been here at Midland College I have never seen anyone given the ovation that was given at the convocation of November 5. What shall one say, or what can one say better than was expressed by the audience.</p>
<p>We shall aways remember the day spent with you with much pleasure.</p>
Sincerely,
