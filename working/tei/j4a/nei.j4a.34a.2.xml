<unclear>How Kala!</unclear>
<p>Well, Falming Rainbow, you were really "all a glow" on the Dick Cavet Show! Congratulations! I have been trying to get this note off to you for weeks and weeks._Now it is (July 20th)_another delay. House guests.</p>
<p>I have not even found time to edit the tapes I made of your TV Special.</p>
<p>Now, it's off to San Francisco again. So more delay- but I'll still keep trying- the Gods are bound to favor me again!</p>
<p>No reply to my letter of inquery to the Lord of Monthly Castle - so the mystery remains for polution in another day and time.</p>
<p>May the Grandfathers favor you and decree that we may meet again</p>
Sincerely
"Wrinkle Skin"
