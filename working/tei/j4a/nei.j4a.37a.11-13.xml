                    <salute>Dear Dr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Thank you for the kind and thoughtful response to the letter I sent you last April.</p>
                
                <p>So you won't be mistaken, let me say I received your letter last June; but only now have I collected some thoughts into readable form. Although by calendar standards our last correspondence was sometime back, my thoughts of you are fresh &#8212; you never seem far away or long ago as people sometimes do.</p> 
                
                <p>I appreciated the note in your letter of June 14th that <hi rend="underline">All Is But a Beginning</hi> would be out on September 20th. I requested the book from a somewhat puzzled bookstore proprietor only hours after it had arrived at the store and well before it had reached the shelves!</p>
                
                <p>I enjoyed the book immensely, being one of those who "loves you just a little," if not more. It was a thrill to relive

                with you those glorious episodes of youth with the accompanying bold emotions. Though you mention in the epilogue the "snow-topped summit" of your years, the wonderful spirit of youth has not faded from you even a years worth. The years seem only to bring you an ever-broadening enthusiasm and a deeper appreciation of this phenomenon of <hi rend="caps">LIFE</hi>.</p> 
                
                <p>Accordingly, <hi rend="underline">All Is But a Beginning</hi> is full of <hi rend="caps">LIFE</hi> &#8212; certainly not just life restricted to the days and events of your youth, but <hi rend="caps">LIFE</hi> the timeless adventure, the total exhilerating experience.</p>
                
                <p>I was especially excited by the lyric "The Ghostly Brother", which I had not read before. The mood of the poem is haunting, almost frightening; yet the theme is, curiously, appealing. The lyric focuses on that spiritual condition inherent in all of your works, which is felt, though not necessarily expressed. I foudn the poem very moving and meaningful.</p>

                <p><hi rend="underline">All Is But a Beginning</hi> was a delightful and invaluable experience for me, as have been the many other works by you I have read. I cherish the beautiful sensitivity expressed on the pages of your books and am happy to share with one so very much aware the "wonder of it all."</p> 
                
                <p>I trust you are nearing completion of the adult portion of your autobiography I have been anxiously looking for it in the book reviews and on the shelves of the bookstore.</p>
                
                <p>You asked in your letter if I had seen you on the Dick Cavett Show. I regret to say I have missed both times the Cavett show with you has been on television. I can only hope it is shown once more.</p> 
                
                <p>Please write me again when you have time. Take care of yourself.</p>
