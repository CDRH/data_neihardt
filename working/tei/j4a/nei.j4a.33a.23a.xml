Dr. John G. Neihardt

Lincoln, Nebraska 68505

Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>Your thoughtful letter is much appreciated. You are very gracious to fit us into your schedule during your visit to Skyrim.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Dr. Neihardt, the photographer and myself will meet you at Skyrim at 1:30 p.m., Friday, October 24. I believe we can put together a truly fine magazine article and picture layout.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm not only interested in you  and your work, but I hope to get some thoughts from you about Missouri and its people. If you have written on this subject, perhaps we also can quote from that.</p>
<p>Again, many thanks for your kindness. And many good wishes for your continued success.</p>
Sincerely, 
<signed>Robert S. Townsend</signed>
