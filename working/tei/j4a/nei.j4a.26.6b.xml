                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt,</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>Many thanks for the box of letters; I will let you know as soon as they arrive so that you will not worry about them. I wish you would send them express collect; getting them boxed and sent is trouble enough, and you certainly should not have any expense in the shipping. That is a small thing for me to do when you are gi<del><unclear>c</unclear></del><add>v</add>ing me so much assistance.</p>
                
                <p>Of course I don't think you are bragging to tell me about speeches. That is important material, and, as you <del>d</del><add>s</add>ay, it's real. The picture isn't full without it. You left ego behind years ago, and I find you much more concerned with truth than anything else. If the nose has a wart you don't want the wart retouched out of the photograph, so to speak. I shall certainly use the Emporia speeches, and the Writers' Conference. That was the time Paul Engle spoke, wasn't it?</p>
                
                <p>I tried to find Mr. Collier when I was in New York, but he is not in the telephone book, and the office of the university was closed. I shall write him again. I have just written to G eorge Bailey and Zander <del>z</del><add>S</add>ulke, whose addresses Mr. Kelly sent me. He has already talked to them and he says they will write. <del>U</del><add>Y</add>esterday I got more <hi rend="underline">Blade</hi> film but I can't read it till Monday.</p>
                
                <p>We certainly enjoyed the visits with you. When we get back in June I hope we can talk about the biography. <del>N</del><add>B</add>y that time I should have <del>assembled</del> more material assembled on the criticisms in the Minneapolis <hi rend="underline">Journal</hi> and the Kansas City <hi rend="underline">Post</hi>, and I'd like to have your recommendations for expanding certain parts. It's a wonderful story to write.</p>

                <p>Remember to tell me about any speeches you make from now on, and when you get to the <hi rend="underline">Poetics</hi> I do want to know what you think of the theories.</p>
                
                <p>Our best wishes to all of you for a happy new year. All your years are good; I hope this one will be special.</p>
                <closer>
                    <salute>Sincerely,</salute>
                </closer>
                
                <postscript>
                    <p>The letters just came, and I dropped everything and read most of them. The only thing that st<del>p</del><add>o</add>pped me is that I wanted to get this letter ready before Bower calls to be picked up.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you read these letters over before you sent them you can imagine how delighted I am. They are wonderful! Mrs. Neihardt's letter about children is beautiful, and yours on prayer is one of the best. There <hi rend="underline">must be</hi> a collection of letters someday--everyone should read these things. They tell a good deal about speeches too. Thank you again for sending them. But do let me pay the charges; if you'll tell me the amount I can s<del>how</del><add>end</add> you a check or stamps.</p>
