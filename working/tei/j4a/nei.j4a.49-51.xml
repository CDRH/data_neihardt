                    <salute>Dear Mr. Neihardt,&#8212;</salute>
                </opener>
                <p>I have been a long time fulfilling my promise to write "a second note,"&#8212; and now I fear it isn't much of one. You see my publishers <unclear>dropped</unclear> me, and after a while I gave the new book to Harcourt, Brace <unclear>as</unclear> <unclear/>, a form that is just beginning,&#8212; and after I had got the first proof to the printers shack,&#8212;and the book which was to have come <unclear/> <unclear>late October</unclear> is not yet in plate proof. But I <unclear>hope</unclear> for it before Christmas. Be kind to it when you see it, for it needs any friends it <unclear>may</unclear> find. I guess Macmillan's haven't been very anxious "to carry me," for quite a while. But it was

                ode, to say the least to have a book refused! But "Everything in a life-time," they say.</p>
                
                <p>Here the fields blossom with poets, like a prairie with flowers in their season: and I <unclear>saying</unclear> the scene,&#8212; "ten thousand saw I at a glance,"&#8212; but there is a kind of melancholy in it, to an "eye that hath kept watch" o'er poet's immortality. I have not found much to draw me from my old loves,&#8212; indeed, I don't see many books these days. Yours has been on my table all summer: and I think I like the landscapes best, with the action all <unclear>nature's</unclear>,&#8212;the scene, and for <unclear>forever</unclear>the breaking up of the ice as the prairie <unclear>fire</unclear> and the wild flight of the wild before it. The human part, the dialect (which annoyed me even in Greek, when I was a boy) troubles my ear,&#8212;my sense of language&#8212; and I don't 
                
                    <fw type="curatorial">51</fw>

                think I ever cared much for rustic character, except in a sort of minor element and reflief to the grief <unclear>figures</unclear> and the whole story. I guess then was a good deal of the high-skipping <unclear/> in my schooling. But <unclear>wider</unclear> task is against me, and seems to approve the "democracy" of the new tale, in Masefield for instance,&#8212; the poem of ordinary lives and traits. I can't <unclear>stand</unclear> a certain higher <unclear/>; before it: you get this element, <unclear>in a reason</unclear>, for the grandeur + freshness of the land, but I want something <hi rend="underline">human</hi>, too, of the same elevation,&#8212;something moral, as much as physical. If this is an <hi rend="underline"><unclear>aristocratic</unclear></hi> <unclear/>&#8212; well, make the best of it!</p>
                
                <p>You write an admirable line, technically,&#8212;it is a pleasure to read it, just as it is a pleasure to hear some people just talk,&#8212; and what a <unclear>distinction</unclear> that is just now! Certainly you have the best <hi rend="underline"><unclear>vision</unclear></hi> of the great plains and "the virgin land." But this is getting to be "a critique." I hope you will have a

                real prairie Thanksgiving.</p>
                
                <p>For myself, I am really very well, and likely to continue "fit" for a while,&#8212; wondering what the gods promise for a superannulated poet. It seems almost like an <unclear/> to think of!&#8212; Well, why not? Ulysses made one. What are heroes for? As Emerson said, "What is <unclear>fate</unclear> for?" When he found himself alone <unclear/> it for <unclear>frankfort</unclear>,&#8212; mine, of course.&#8212; But I shall think twice before cutting my <unclear>moorings</unclear> again.</p>
