<salute>Dear Professor Neihardt,</salute>
</opener>
			<p>I have just finished reading your most
interesting book, " Eagle Voice " for the umpeenth time.</p>
			<p>Your story of the old world Sioux is
one of the most informative books I have ever had the honour of
reading.	In particular I appreciated the translation of
some of their words.	I am, and have been for many a long
year, a keen reader of the old West and the Indian tribes that once
roamed it in complete freedom.</p>

			<p>It seems to me that in nearly every
film I have ever seen it is always " the wicked, blood thirsty
Indians " that are the villains of the piece, whilst the American
militia were proverbial angels by comparison.	 However, after
persuing some good informative books, once can see the true story, -
that of the slow, but nevertheless methodical anihalation of the
true American.	Some of these massacres perpertrated by the
troops representing the United States Government, - on the Indian
tribes they were supposed to be " protecting " make any Russian
action in Hungary seem like a childs tea party by comparison.</p>

			<p>I should like to add, should you assume
that I have " Red " tendencies, that I hold no brief for anything
approaching Communism ! ! !</p>

			<p>You are to be envied having had a life
time of close contact with the <del/> Sioux, I think my life's ambition
                             
would to save enough money to make a tour of the West, visiting
such famous places as Sand Creek, Wounded Knee, Little Big-Horn,
(or, as it is translated, Greasy Grass) - to say nothing

<note>P.T.O.</note>

<pb/>

of the reservations where Crazy Horse was bayonetted to death, -
or the Pine Ridge Reservation where Sitting Bull was shot by
the "Metal Breasts".</p>

<p>I have read Stanley Vestal's "Sitting Bull" -
a truly wonderful book which contradicts everything James McLaughlin
said about that famous Indian (Sitting Bull - or is it Sendentary
Taurus ? ? !!!!) in his own book entitled "My Friend the Indian",
this last named book, was, in my opinion, a mere justification
for the foul murder of Sitting Bull, which Vestal maintains was engineered by McLaughlin because of his jealousy of Sitting Bull,
and the influence he had over the reservation Indian.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull always maintained that the fairest deal he ever had with the white man was whilst he was temporarily
domiciled in "THE Granmother's Land" - Canada to the uninitiated,
this temporary residence of his, was as you are quite obviosly aware,
taken after his defeat, (with other notable Indian chiefs) of
Custer at the Little Big-Horn. I emphasise the word defeat,
NOT massacre, as the majority of American historians prefer it.</p>

<p>I understand massacre to mean the slaughter of
unarmed people without the means to retaliate, I can hardly believe
that Custer's Seventh Calvary was either of these two things!!!!.</p>

<p>To conclude, I would appreciate any titles of
good, historical, books that you could recomend me to read, in
anticipation of your reply, I remain,</p>

<closer><salute>Yours Faithfully,</salute>
