Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>The Nationa Anthropological Archives is building up a reference collection of materials on the Dakota Indians. We would like to obtain a xerox copy of the transcripts of conversations between  yourself and Black Elk. Mrs. Nancy C. Prewitt of the University of Missouri, Joint Collection of the Western Historical Society Manuscripts, has directed us to apply to you for permission. We hope that you will approve of our request.</p>
<p>With best regards.</p>
Sincerely yours,
