Mr. John G. Neihardt

Dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>Thank you for your letter. I am enclosing an unfolded parchment sheet on which you can comment on <underline>A Bundle of Myrrh</underline>, when you feel like it. I think it is a good idea to lay this extra sheet in when it returns here. We shall eventually rebind the xerox copy in a finer binding. This one is simply to protect it temporarily.</p>
<p>I am having a special case made for <underline>The Devine Enchantment</underline> and will advise you about it when it is ready.</p>
<p>We shall continue to pursue the leads you gave us, includ-ing Professor Sanford D. Gray.</p>
<p>Later in the year, I hope that I may find the time to get out to see you.</p>
<p>Kindest regards.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Frank P Piskor</signed>
