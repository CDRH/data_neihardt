Dear Dr. Neihardt,
I have a very special favor to ask of you, and assuming you will do it have enclosed a copy of All Is But a Beginning for your inscription and return to me. I need it for a very special friend, Bonita Pabst. She is a Neihardt "lover" and I can think of nothing more special than this to give her. She and I are co-authoring a critical study of the Indian in American historical fiction (for which, incidentally, your When the Tree Flowered has served as an admirable model). I think she is a wakan person, and I've named her "White Buffalo Cow Woman." Would you be so kind as to inscribe this volume to Bonita, White Buffalo Cow Woman, with some special message? I will be forever grateful, and so will the lady. I've enclosed some money to cover costs of return. 
How is the adult section of the autobiography progressing? Very well I hope. I have a good tape of our visit with you in May. I hope this finds you feeling well and in good spirits. 
Many thanks for considering my request. With kind thoughts, I am 
Sincerely yours, 
Leo E. Oliva
