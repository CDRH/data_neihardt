                <p>Forgive me for not having written you sooner to acknowledge several of your letters and to report progress.</p>
                
                <p>Tonight I have finished the last of the full page drawings (4 in number) and they go off to Latham tomorrow. They are <hi rend="underline">rotten</hi> and I have told him to use them or not as he sees fit. I seem to be just about drained and, try as I would, the few wouldn't perform.</p>
                
                <p>To date I have had from the MacMillan<sic>Macmillan</sic> Co one letter signed by Latham's secretary so I don't know the state of affairs. I sent 9 full page drawings on Oct 20.</p> 
                
                <p>I've decided to give up trying to stick this London climate and we are sailing Dec. 3. for a place about 4000 miles west of here. Have a drink on it!</p>
                
                <p>It will be necessary to step out

                    with all four feet for the next month and I shall not be able to finish my Missouri capitol panels either. But the thought of home and the hills makes anything bearable for a month.</p>
                
                <p>About 8 years ago you asked how many copies of the 500 de lux edition I wanted. Well, I want 500 but will be content with 5 or ten (five or 10) I have that many friends who know a good thing when they see it. I'd say 50 copies and keep that many out of circulation if I were to voice my disappointment that way; disappointment at having fallen so short of what could have been done.</p>
                
                <p>And when I come to think of it, it was rather a strange job illustrating something of which I had only seen the skeleton!! I didn't try to <hi rend="underline">illustrte</hi> anything. I just tried to decorate pages and intimate something of the atmosphere in which your actions and poetry live. To have "illustrated" facts would have been stupid. To have made

                    pictures of what you wrote would have been trying to paint the lily. But Hell! Look them over when you get a chance and accept the intention and purpose rather than the accomplishment.</p>
                
                <p>And there you are! I'm working too hard in a climate that doesn't agree with me and a change will do me good.</p> 
                
                <p>I'm <unclear>crazy</unclear> to see the Wars but don't suppose it will be until I get back to the <hi rend="caps">U.S.A.</hi> After London (Dec.3) My next address will be 1421 <hi rend="caps">N.</hi> Cascade Ave. Colorado Springs. Colo.</p>
