Lincoln, Nebraska 68505

Dear Dr. Neihardt:
<p>We are looking forward to your visit on Monday, April 19. We wish it were possible to meet your first choices, but our calendar is already filled for March 15 and March 16 (Friday) will probable find our campus empty as students take off for their homes.</p>
<p>We definitely want an all-community appearance in the evening. But would it tax you too much to visit with our students for an hour in mid-Afternoon? And what are your wishes for dinner with a small group preceding the evening lecture?</p>
<p>I have not yet heard from Mrs. Young.</p>
Sincerely,
<signed>Silas E. Summers</signed>
