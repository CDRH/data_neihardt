No place to stay, so we went to Greely for the night. Next morning we went back to Windsor &amp; old Joanie answered the phone<del/> when I called.

I sat down &amp; realized I'd have to turn on all my charm so I did; and even so, it was nip and <del/> tuck for a while.

She's a precious, &amp; very pretty. Joanie is a raving beauty, a real knockout! My! My! She always was beautiful, but now it's such a rich, full-bloom, gracious beauty. We ate lunch with the K's, and then took out for Estes

                    Park, 34 miles west. There I learned that Mrs. Enos A. Mills is still living near the old Long's Peak Inn, now called Swiss Village. You know, Mills was the father of the Rocky Mountain National Park. He was a great fan of mine, &amp; first wrote me when Hugh Glass appeared. We were friends by nature When he died his wife wrote me a sweet letter. (That was

                    25 or 30 years ago &#8212; maybe more. Well, I went to see Mrs. Mills, and she was really overjoyed. So was I. She is a dear old lady with what you called "the carnation <del/> look" our Nanny had. She runs a <del/> little bookstore just for busywork. (She must be wealthy, <del><unclear>having s</unclear></del> having sold a very valuable property.)</p>

                <p>I feel fairly sure that you did not see the <hi rend="underline">island</hi>: It's still there, very easy to see if you go to it (about 150 yds southwest of the present monument). You know there were <hi rend="underline">no</hi> trees <add>on the island</add> when the battle took place, except the sapling cottonwood at the lower (eastward) point of the island.
