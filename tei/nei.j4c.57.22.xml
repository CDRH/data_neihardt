<salute>Dear Hilda,</salute>
</opener>

<p>I have been thinking that we should make an effort to interest some movie agent in my <hi rend="underline">When the Tree Flowered</hi>. As you know, it is ideal movie material, especially now that Indians are popular. It offers a complete Sioux story from boyhood and girlhood to maturity, and certainly it is romantic. It's a queer thing that no one has known of its value.</p>

<p>I heard from John Maddon by phone this evening. He insists that I must let him know whnever I want to go any place, and there will be plane for me. I am considering taking up his offer for a flight to Eugene, Oregon, as I need desperately to have a talk with Lucile <choice><sic>Aley</sic><corr>Aly</corr></choice>. John says he could get me there in an hour and forty-five minutes.from Lincoln. John and I have agreed to make the trip to Columbia in late May when Erica is married. I am to "give her away."</p>

<p>Do you have any way of learning the names of reputable movie agents? Do you think it might be all right to ask DeWitt <choice><sic>too</sic><corr>to</corr></choice> help us in this, at the same time suggesting that he himself might be interested in <hi rend="underline">When the Tree Flowered</hi>?</p>

<p>I have just completed the first half of <hi rend="underline">The Old Man Remembers</hi> &#8212;&#8212; forty thousand words. I now see it, however, as a complete little book of about two hundred pages on my boyhood and early youth. It really is a complete thing and I judge from its effect on those who have heard it or read it that it does have quite a wallop. I am even thinking it might be well to offer it to a publisher. The Nebraska University Press of course will take it in a hurry, and I judge from the recent sucess of my books that I might have some bargaining power if they were given the book. I think it's pretty smart to consider the complete though shorter book. What do you think?</p>

<p>I think of you and all your children very often and with great love. They are all so utterly fine and worthwhile. And so are you, Hiddy.</p>

<p>I feel a little sad when I think of Alice losing both her girls and her grandson.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to the time when I can see you again. &#8212;&#8212; about the eighteenth of April maybe?</p>
