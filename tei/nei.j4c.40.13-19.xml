                <p>Yes, it <hi rend="underline">will</hi> be fun to be together again. I don't know yet just when I can come, but it looks like the second week of July now. There's a big gap from Omaha on June 7th to June 28th when Stanley wants to begin the trip of a week or ten days in our trailer. I suppose I can fill the time with a few horse shows.</p>
               
                <p>Anyway here's some news you'll like. Gail won a $2500 scholarship <del>to</del> from Christian College - one year in residence, all expenses paid. If she maintains her grades she'll get a scholarship for the second year.</p>
                
                <p>Also, Gail received the American Legion award for general

                    <p>Old Robin <del/> was honored last night at the Jeff Junior show for general excellence.  <hi rend="underline">Some <del/> kids</hi>!</p>
                
                <p>The India business looks promising. The committee sent for a medical certificate, and I had to be examined. (I'm very sick with Milkmaid's Knee, Consumption of Victuals, and Loss of Normal Consciousness at Night. There are barbarous Greekish names for these ailments, but I don't know them.) Of course, I may yet be turned down. Just wrote to the Director of the business in New Delhi in reply to <del/> stern questions of an official nature.</p>

                <p>The National Educational Television Center in New York has finally accepted that series for which I acted as <hi rend="underline">host</hi> - <hi rend="underline">Land of <del/> Their Own</hi>. It will get around the country. The <hi rend="underline">Library of the Plains</hi> has asked for six samples of my

                    <hi rend="underline">live</hi> interview on TV next day, the 7th.  That evening I'll be guest at dinner at the Country Club. I wish you were going to be there to eat a piece or two of fried chicken and a pea or two with maybe a dab of mashed potato.</p>
