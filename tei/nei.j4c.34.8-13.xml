                <p>I was <hi rend="underline">so</hi> sorry to receive your lovely letter of Oct. 25th. In going to the mailbox every day for weeks, months, and almost years, I had come to feel safe from any further epistolary intrusion (this is litrachoor ) from you. Day after day, after examining the contents* of the mailbox with trepidation (more litrachoor ) I'd exclaim "Goody, goody, no letter today!" And then &#8212; all of a sudden &#8212; <hi rend="underline">my god! another letter!</hi> You can <hi rend="underline">imagine how taken aback I was</hi>!

                <p>* (Footnote: Categorically <add>speaking</add><del/>, the<del>se</del> foregoing statements are absolutely false! The fact is that I had forgotten all about you and was almost pleasantly surprised when your letter arrived. After some thought, I remembered you.)</p>

                    <p>Since we now have a perfectly clear understanding, I'll answer your very dull and boring letter (It is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> dull and boring! It's <hi rend="italic">lovely</hi>!) Well, first I must tell you about the Royal. We had bad luck in a way; but we had good look too. We took Bourbon Stonewall <del/><add>and</add> my three-gaited pony, Spring Dream. Bourbon competed with a big field of top horses <add>(from all over America)</add> &#8212; all of them experienced &#8212; and, altho' a junior he took sixth. But

                the horsemen were excited about him, &amp; several asked that a price be put on him. Marty Muller of Barrington, Ill., one of the foremost horsemen and trainers of the country, said, "He is the best young horse I ever saw!" He was, indeed, the outstanding horse in that ring, I can tell you; and Alice made a good ride, a <hi rend="underline">corking</hi> good ride, against men riders <del>who</del>who did everthing to block and frustrate <del/> her. She said today, "Next time I'll not feel apologetic &#8212; I'll

                <p>Both Bourbon and little Dream had bad cases of distemper &#8212; runny noses, and droopiness. Bourbon got in <choice><sic>their</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> &amp; did his damndest, but little Dream <hi rend="underline">poked</hi> around the ring. We could hardly believe <del/> our eyes!

                Well, she lost to the pony she beat at the State Fair &#8212; Sugar Time; and, really, no kidding, she is far &amp; away the better <del>pony</del> pony. But <del>ever</del> even though she lost, there were several efforts to buy her, for her quality is apparent. (Isn't this a perfectly <hi rend="underline">lovely</hi> letter?

                <p>It's fine that you have found so much in Smart Set. I remember now, but I <hi rend="underline">had</hi> forgotten.
