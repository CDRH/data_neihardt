                <p>If you write me any more about thick steaks, roasted on spits, and Olympia Beer, "the pride of Oregon", I'll be deserting my dog, my students, my grader, and taking a plane hell-bent for the Land of Eternal Spring and Summer where the greening earth is strewn with camelia petals and the birds never cease to sing! Don't do it! I'm too fond of temptation! But I'll tell you what you <hi rend="underline">can</hi> do. The next time you and Bower look over the top of <del/>

                    tall mugs of Olympia, stand erect, facing Columbia, brace yourself, take a deep, deep breath, and with a great gust blow the foam at me, saying, as you do so: "John, here's mud in your eye!" (That's the vernacular for <hi rend="underline"><unclear/></hi>!) I'll be rambling around here, innocent as a lamb, when suddenly that chinook wind of gemutlickeit from Eugene will strike me across 2,000 thirsty miles! At first, I'll think it's an attack

                <p>There's another serious matter suggested by your letter. You remark that now and then you fancy yourself walking around Skyrim. Of course you know of the psychic phenomenon described as a "phantasm of the living". Such things certainly <hi rend="underline">do</hi>

                    <hi rend="underline">in a brown study</hi>, when, <del/><add>rounding</add> the corner of a hedge, I'll come suddenly upon you!

                    and my abridged Liddell and Scott lexicon. To think that when I was using them you either were not here yet, or eating mama milk! And I did not know you were on your way! There <hi rend="underline">are</hi> patterns, aren't there? Beautiful marvelous patterns! And if there weren't this life <hi rend="underline">would</hi> be a heluva mess!</p>

I'm interested in your plan for choral reading, and I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> hope I may hear a reading chorus trained by you. I've thought about your conception of the love lyrics &#8212; the spiritual growth in them &#8212; their development

                    <hi rend="underline">throughout</hi> the poetry? Here and there it breaks forth briefly in passing; but have you read the opening passage of <hi rend="underline">The Song of the Messiah</hi> recently> There it takes on a cosmic aspect, and still it has the passion (suggested) of the early "exploratory" love, <hi rend="underline">de-personalized</hi>. (That epithet is yours, and it is a corking good one!) That passage even now gets into my blood!

                <p>Sigurd is slowly living down the "radiation sickness" (after 42 super-powerful treatments). He cannot be pronounced free of the incubus short of three years. Poor Sig!
