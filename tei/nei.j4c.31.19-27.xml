                <p>Hurrah! Hurrah! Yours of Feb. 1st arrived today, having left Eugene on the 3rd. It made all the difference with this poor old man, I can tell you! I was afraid you were sick, and I'm so sorry you've been troubled with that old <del/> asthma and a sore throat. But evidently the "red medicine" has been effective, and so I shout Hurrah for red medicine!</p>

                    by way of being sure I've done so. Mrs. Jett is one of my students, the wife of a wheel in the Columbia Tribune. She took all three of my courses and was a hard worker. She is a pianist, composes some charming little songs, and has <add>often</add> accompanied Hilda's singing in public. I know her only as a student, an enthusiastic one. You may have seen her. She is a very corpulent person</p>
               
                <p>John Collier was not notified. They didn't think of him, I suppose. The present Commissioner

                <p>About William Hodge, the actor. He was the big <add>Broadway</add> star at the time when <hi rend="underline">"Mr. Waters"</hi> appeared in Smart Set. He was under the management of Liebler &amp; Co., and his big hit was Booth Tarkington's "<hi rend="underline">The</hi> Man From Home". Liebler wired me to meet him at the Auditorium Hotel in Chicago. I did, and Hodge, Liebler &amp; I had dinner together. We were going to dramatize

                    <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi>. Here is another point that you can use. In 1901-1902 or near that time (probably 1902) <del/> the magazine called <hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> <del/> published a poem

                    by me entitled <hi rend="underline">To a Hatpin</hi>! My god! Actually, that was the title! What's more, Truth was one of the classiest of "slick" magazines and the poem was about a pretty girl called Edith Perdee. I used to <del>skate skate</del> <add>skate</add> with her (10-20-30 below zero!) &amp; she had long golden hair! <del><unclear>It</unclear></del> I used to see her drying it in the sun.

                    lived across the street. I have not seen that poem for nearly 60 years. Could you find it somehow? Years afterward when I was lecturing,  I met the girl. She was married &amp; had children, She, her husband &amp; I talked of old times, &amp; she &amp; I laughed (with a feel of unshed tears) about the time when I dreamed

                    of her and she of me, and nothing was said about it. (Funny and a little heart-achy too!) That girl's hair (golden) hung down below her hips, I tell you, Lucile! I used to quote: "All fair, all fair, let down your long gold hair!" <add>(this to myself!)</add></p> 
                
                <p>You ask about Bronson Howard. He was the author of the overwhelmingly popular drama, <hi rend="underline">The Old Homestead</hi>, which flourished for at least a generation, and was still going when I was

                    a youngster. I understand that <hi rend="underline">no</hi> other drama ever ran so long &#8212; not even <hi rend="underline">Uncle Tom</hi>. Well, the evening <del/> I spent at the Author's Club with old Henry Holt (the Zeus of the publishing world) I met Howard, then very old and a bit doddering. We liked each other, &amp; <del>when he</del> when he said he must go <del/> home, I went with him

                    to the streetcar (This was in 1907). There was a heavy, <del/> wet snowstorm in progress, <del/><add>and</add> we trudged through snow halfway to our knees. I put him on the street car, &amp; never saw him again. He died that winter.</p> 
                
                <p>I am glad and surprised that Sandy actually sent you the tape of my Lyrics program. I <hi rend="underline">do</hi> hope he will have the records soon. I'm to <del><unclear>tal</unclear></del> read lyrics at Christian College again next Monday.

                <p>The other day a big, masculine fellow who was in my Epic America class came to me in the hall &amp; said: "What the class did at the end of the semester certainly got to me." His eyes went wet as he said this. I knew what he meant. He was referring to the applause of the class when I said goodbye.</p>
