                <p>You evidently had a "veridical" dream &#8212; or at least, it may well be so. When you were dreaming of us all (and note that you <hi rend="underline">did</hi> seem to see us <hi rend="underline">all</hi>, or at least felt conscious of us) <hi rend="underline">we were all together at Skyrim</hi>. There were 13 of us &#8212; children, sons-in-law, and grandchildren and we were <del/> celebrating the new year. It was a champagnish evening, ending

                    after midnight! It is probable that our rejoicing <hi rend="underline">in unison</hi> somehow got to you. Anyway, it could be so. I'm <hi rend="underline">so glad</hi> you did feel us, as I <del/> believe you did. Alice &amp; Enid have seen your letter and I'll show it to Hilda. (They don't like you at all, just as this old man doesn't too!!)</p>

                    of a good authoritative source, willing to tell anything resonably decent about my experiences! Truly, I could, and can, help you a great deal. Documents are of great value, but in some instances they are untrustworthy. I do want you to question me whenever you need my memories. And as you have noted, I <hi rend="italic">do remember</hi>. I did not realize that my remembering, as I do, was unusual; but I've come to know it <hi rend="underline">is</hi> so.</p>

                    <p>I'm sending three letters on my appearances at the Westerners dinner in New York City. I showed <del><unclear>them</unclear></del><add>them</add> to old Bower. (By the way, it was a joy to be with him <del/> even for a short time. You know, I don't like him <del/> either!) You may return the letters in your next after you've copied the right paragraph from each. I may want them again. Then later you'll have them with many other letters that have been turning up.</p>

                <p>This reminds me to say that I'm deeply interested in the plan for the "Neihardt Memorial Collection" (Library and Papers) here. When you are through with the things I've given you, they will be deposited <del/> here, I know. As for the collection you've made at considerable expense, I'd hope it also might <hi rend="underline">ultimately</hi> be here, and in my will I am indicating that you are to

                    be reimbursed for your expenditures, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> you turn your collection over to Missouri. If you want your material in the Congressional Library or elsewhere, microfilm copies will come to Missouri anyway.</p>
                
                <p>I know there's something pathetic about my caring <del/> so much about this matter. I <hi rend="underline">know</hi> I'll be so far away that this will all be less than nothing

                    <p>Here is a big idea!! Tell me what you think of it, and whether you care to follow it up. You may already know that <hi rend="underline">The Indian Wars</hi> was chosen as one of the 500 books from World Literature to be the White <del/> House Library. (This, I seem to remember, was in Hoover's <del>admin<unclear/></del> administration.) Well, Alice Roosevelt Longworth was one of the national committee that chose the 500 books for the White House Library. This committee was from all parts of <hi rend="caps">U. S.</hi> Alice Longworth is, as you know, still living.

                    Would you, as my biographer, care to write her? You would want to mention the fact that her daddy, Theodore <hi rend="caps">R</hi>, knew &amp; liked <hi rend="underline">Hugh Glass</hi>, as I learned from Corinne R. Robinson at the Poetry Society banquet in 1927. Alice Longworth, I'm told, is a fine person, and perhaps she would give you something usable in <del/> your work. You'd seem to be writing

Could she name the others on the committee?? Did she ever speak with her daddy about <hi rend="italic">Glass</hi>? You'd know how to ask the proper questions. And you'd tell how my admiration for <hi rend="caps">T. R.</hi> has increased with the years, and

I read and read about <del><unclear/>and</del> him, and always I feel uplifted as I read. You might want to say that Herman Hagedorn, <hi rend="caps">T.
