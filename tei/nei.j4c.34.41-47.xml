                <p>I was  <hi rend="underline">so</hi> glad to hear from you again and to know that you were back at home getting well. I did worry about you, and I still want to feel  <hi rend="underline">sure</hi> that you are all right.</p>
                
                <p>It's good that Stanley and Phyllis sent you clippings &amp; reports of the unveiling in Lincoln on Dec. 7. It's hard to communicate the  <hi rend="underline">mood</hi> of the whole affair and the  <hi rend="underline">details</hi>. You got much of it, evidently, when you noted that the articles "almost sing". That's the most notable thing to me. The Senate chamber was full of that feeling

                    during the ceremony &amp; while I was talking. Then came the luncheon with about 200 guests from all over the state, and 
                    <hi rend="underline">that</hi> was even  <hi rend="underline">more so</hi> because it was more intimate. I think you know I read the Vision of Wovoka after my little speech. It  <hi rend="italic">did</hi> go over and <hi rend="underline">have</hi> you a copy of my remarks? Dr. Winkleman was especially impressed with the talk - along with others.</p>
                
                <p>Your tribute to Mona  <hi rend="underline">was</hi> <unclear/>, and many spoke of it. I was so glad you did that, and so were the girls. If you have my talk

                        you'll know how I felt about Mona's place in the affair. <del/></p>
                
                <p>I must send you some photos and several letters of regret. Truman said "I'm just as sorry as I can be" that he couldn't be present. He was in Los Angeles that day. Mari Sandoz wrote simply, most generously &amp; beautifully. She's a good girl as well as a heluva good writer.</p>
                
                    <p>The Governor, Frank Morrison, is a huge, loveable man. He was so dear with me <hi rend="underline">and</hi> the others, especially the children. When he held my hand, it was

                <p>People I hadn't seen for from 25 to 40 years were at the luncheon. <del/> One chap told me <del/> of a prairie chicken hunt we had together in the sandhills of Nebraska 40 some years ago. <hi rend="underline">According to his story,</hi> I took his 20 <choice><sic>guage</sic><corr>gauge</corr></choice> shot-gun &amp; brought down a flying chicken at an  <hi rend="italic">incredible</hi> <hi rend="underline">distance</hi>! <hi rend="underline">I have</hi> <hi rend="italic">no</hi> <hi rend="underline">such memory</hi>!</p>

                    that afternoon I recorded (on tape) for three hours (about) giving reminiscences of old-timers, white and Indian, that I've known. Dr. Danker, the archivist, did the recording, and Phyllis says he played it all over &amp; is delighted. They will save the tape, altho' they first planned merely to make a <del/> typed transcript.</p>
