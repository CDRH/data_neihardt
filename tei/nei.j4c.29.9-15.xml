                <p>You wrote me such a lovely letter that I feel obligated to write you a lovely letter, and this is it.</p>
                
                <p>I <hi rend="underline">was</hi> delighted to hear from you <hi rend="underline">at last</hi>; not that I felt you "owed" me a letter &#8212; you never owe me anything &#8212; but I had heard from Martha &amp; Bower<del/> and, indirectly, from Perky &#8212; but nothing from you; I felt perfectly awful!

                horse show at Sedalia. Big doings, I can tell you! Everybody who is anybody in horsedom, was there with his stallions, geldings, mares, and fillies. By golly, <del>you</del> <add>we</add> had competition for sure! We won 4th with Bourbon Stonewall (our wonderful stallion who is only a little boy yet &#8212; just 3 years old.) Bourbon was, according to everyone, the most magnificently beautiful horsie in the ring of around 20 horses. But he is only a country

So he got 4th. He <hi rend="italic">did</hi> stand out like a mountain peak above foothills. When the Judge came around to where Alice &amp; Bourbon were parked, he said to Alice: "Girl, in another year you're going to have a wonderful horse." Earl Arnold, a top trainer &amp; horseman, came to the stables

                <p>You don't seem to feel bad because I was so miserable <del/> at your house. I should think you'd feel awful the way I did before your letter came.</p>
                
                <p>We won at Huntsville and Shelbina, but we had a bad slump at the Boone County Fair show here. Two of our horses were out of shape. But we got a second and <del/> a fifth</p>

He came from Maine &#8212; is driving to Denver and his visit with me was the fulfillment of a promise he made himself long ago that he would manage to see me. Nice chap; and he
