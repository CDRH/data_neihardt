                <p>I was so glad to hear from you. It seemed a long while between whiles, but I knew you were busy; and now I know about Gramby's adventure. 
                <hi rend="underline">Hurrah</hi> for her! There's nothing sad about it, except, of course, that she was Bower's mother and is not here anymore. Otherwise, <hi rend="underline">hurrah</hi>!! <hi rend="underline">She believed something and lived her belief, and she must have done a whole of a lot of good</hi>! I <hi rend="underline">hope</hi>, and almost believe, that she has found her Baptist heaven. Why not? There's a rumor to the effect that in the spirit world one's thoughts are creative. I liked Gramby &amp; I had the impression that she did <hi rend="underline">not dislike</hi> me. Bless her!</p>

                    <p>I wrote to you on March 3rd, but did not mail the letter, for I knew you would write in good time. In that letter I reported a reading at the Student Union in the Literary Hour. That was March 1st. It was a wow. They acted hypnotized and then exploded. Also, they kept me going a full hour. Whatever it is that works in these affairs is clearly growing stronger. <del><unclear>Its</unclear></del>It's very noticeable to me. I wonder why it's so. It was the same at the <hi rend="caps">U.</hi> of So. Dak. I'll send a couple of letters. I should gather up a number of others for you too).</p>

                                            <p>I do think that perhaps Tennyson was the earliest powerful influence, because I discovered the Idylls at 12, as you know. Then Browning's lyrics came next, I suppose. I used to carry pocket volumes of these. I read hungrily in all the English classes, of course. <hi rend="underline">Emerson came late &#8212;very late.</hi> I had been prejudiced against him 
                                            <hi rend="underline">as a man</hi>. I still do not really like his type; but I do profoundly admire his work. Plato, also, came very late, and was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> <hi rend="triple underline">stronger</hi> <hi rend="underline">when he came</hi>. <note type="authorial">I felt I knew him, altho' I didn't swallow him whole.</note></p> <closer><signed>John</signed></closer>

                                                    <p>I have old John Hunton's Diary. I was with him nearly a day about 40 years ago. He had bought Fort Laramie (where he was a sutter in the 70's) and was living there with his young (second) wife.</p>

                                                    <p>The Diary is fascinating. I can hardly leave it alone. To read in it is, for me at least, <del>like</del> like being in that country during the gold-rush Black Hills days &amp; the last Sioux wars. It's the very <hi rend="underline">trivial</hi> nature of the entries that is so convincing &#8212; trivial-seeming <hi rend="underline">now</hi>, but the common stuff of living then.</p>
                                                        
                                                        <p>I seem so close to those days, sometimes living right <hi rend="underline">in</hi> them.</p>
