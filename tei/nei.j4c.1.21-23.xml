<salute>Dear Mr. Davis:&#8212;</salute>
</opener>
	<p>Your letter of the 5th inst. has pleased me so much in
the re-reading, and I am so delighted with your incorrigible
honesty, that I am strongly moved to drop you a line.</p>
	<p>I have no doubt that your knowledge of me is sufficient
to assure you that I would rather have one sincere rough word
flung in my teeth than to listen to a whole serenade of
euphonious syllables that lie. Therein lies the charm of your
letter. As a cross between <hi rend="underline">Adese</hi> and <hi rend="underline">Townsendish</hi> (I am forced
to coin words) it is undeniably clever;</p>
	<p>But &#8212;<lb/>
	It is <hi rend="underline">not criticism</hi>!</p>
	<p>"I don't like those primitive women who pass through three
strata of the social geology to get into the blue mud and wallow"!</p>
	<p>What of <hi rend="underline">that</hi>?</p>
	<p>Neither do <hi rend="underline">I</hi> particularly "like" the bull-frog that croaks
in the slime and ooze &#8212; yet, unfortunately perhaps, that same
frog is an undeniable fact.</p>
	<p>I think you will hardly dispute me when I affirm that
Flaubert's "Madame Bovary" is a rare masterpiece. Yet, who in
God's name "likes" a woman of the Madame's type - a silly hussy
of a country town pulling the wool over the eyes of the child-like
Doctor? <hi rend="underline">I</hi> don't "like" Madame Bovary the <hi rend="underline">personality</hi>, but my
dislike in no way affects Madame Bovary the <hi rend="underline">character</hi>.
Surely no man "likes" the personality of Vantrin, the human viper
of the many incarnations; but nevertheless all intelligent men
must grant the greatness of him <hi rend="underline">as a character in fiction</hi>.
Who would want Becky Sharp for a wife or a sister or a mother?
But is she, as a character, not a great creation? I would not
"like" the erratic and often despisable Richmond Roy for a father,
but nevertheless I admire him as a character creation.</p>
	<p>You must distinguish between the <hi rend="underline">personality</hi> of the character
depicted and the <hi rend="underline">character itself</hi> as a creation; and you can never
turn out true criticism until you do.</p>
	<p>"The right kind of a woman"!</p>
	<p>In the name of God, my friend, is Literature to be merely
a catalogue of the Virtues? What are we going to do with the other
99% of humanity? Or have you succumbed to the popular ideal
which reduces literature to a dress suit and an evening gown
racing madly for the parson's, with all post-nuptial details
carefully supressed?</p>
	<p>Am I to understand that Literature has for its mission
the entertainment of kindergartners?</p>
	<p>As an act of friendship, it seems that I must acquaint
you with the fact that Literature is "neither moral nor immoral",
but absolutely independent of moral considerations! Deny this
fact, and then watch the greatest masterpieces of the world 
go up in smoke for you! Deny this fact, and tell me what you
have done with that which is one of the  very greatest of human
masterpieces &#8212; the Bible!</p>

	<p>You are merely flippant when you announce that you can "buy
for $1.60 per ounce better perfume than any French grisette
ever exhaled in her life"; and you will not be unfair enough
to deny that of all cheap things, flippancy is the cheapest!</p>
	<p>You think that "the girl should have been pinched on the
Rue de Rivoli at about fourteen"!</p>
	<p>Why, my friend, I don't deny <hi rend="underline">that</hi>! But what has that
fact to do with literary values? I was not producing a model of
the virtues! That sentence of yours might have been written
by the most English of Englishmen! Had you forgotten that Yellow
Fox is telling the story, and naturally colors it according to
his understanding? Did <hi rend="underline">I</hi> offer the girl as an angel? Of course
she should have been "pinched" &#8212; you are quite correct there.</p>
	<p>Your last allusion to "Huyler's candy" and "American Beauty
roses" does you an injustice. You are <hi rend="underline">not</hi> ignorant of the
great truth which you feign to have missed; I need not argue
with you on that point. I wonder if you have ever spent much
time on Kraft-Ebing. Also I wonder if you are really ignorant
of the relation of the sense of smell to the passion of love
among primitive peoples.</p>
	<p>You approach "Mignon" as though you were horribly frightened!
I am wondering if you sing in the choir of some very hard-shelled
Baptist church! I could almost accuse you of telling your beads!
If a woman or some "hen-minded" male had written that letter,
I could have pigeon-holed it without another thought; but that
a <hi rend="underline">man</hi> should resort temporarily to merely feminine "reasons"
simply astounds me!</p>
	<p>As to the probability of the story, I have the full Nelson
on you there &#8212; for the story actually happened, and I have proof
that the woman in the case was sufficiently attractive to set
the whole country agog.</p>
	<p>You temporarily suppressed your knowledge of human
possibilities when you protested against "wikiups and river-
bottoms for a honeymoon".</p>
	<p>Now for another side of the case: If "The Luck of Roaring
Camp" were written today by an unknown Bret Harte and offered
to you, what would you do about it? Why, you'd fire it back
in holy horror with a flippant protest against the vulgar
practice of giving a baby a she-ass for a mother! Of course
you would &#8212; I could almost produce the very letter that you would
send. And you would also hint that "Cherokee Sal" was probably
not ready to go to heaven when she cashed in!</p>
	<p>Now really, <hi rend="underline">can't</hi> you imagine yourself writing just about
that kind of stuff to that unknown Bret Harte?</p>
	<p>I think it is hardly necessary for me to assure you that
my reference to masterpieces in this letter are made only
for the sake of illustration. I am by no means shallow enough
to compare "Mignon" with masterpieces. I am merely taking
a fling at superficial criticism in general and this single
evidence of it that I have yet found in your letters.</p>
	<p>Not so did you write of the <hi rend="underline">pups</hi> in the first version of
"The Alien". You objected to that portion of the story upon
perfectly legitimate grounds - its incompatibility with the
requirements of your magazine. And you will remember that I fell
in at once with your suggestion, readily recognizing the soundness
of your position.</p>

<pb facs="nei.j4c.1.21-23_0003" />
<fw type="authorial">-3-</fw>
<fw type="curatorial">23</fw>

<p>It is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> the rejection of "Mignon" of which I am writing.
Have you not rejected several manuscripts of mine? But in doing
so you did not resort to feminine reasoning.</p>
	<p>You will note that I have been quite as frank as you were;
and I need not assure you that I am incapable of the least
bitterness toward a man who calls me his friend and then 
tells me what he thinks.</p>
	<p>I attack not Davis the man, the Davis the <hi rend="underline">critic</hi> in his most
uncritical mood.</p>
	<p>Surely we are getting rather well acquainted!</p>
