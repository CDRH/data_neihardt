                <p>That letter was like a fine rain after a rather long drouth! And I know what I mean, because we have been suffering for rain these many weeks, with the temperature around 100Â° in the shade.</p>
                
                <p>I <hi rend="underline">thought</hi> and <hi rend="underline">thought</hi> and <hi rend="underline">wondered</hi> and <hi rend="underline">wondered</hi>, I knew of course, that you were buzzing around making others a little happier &#8212; bless you! But I had a slumped feeling, and I needed to be back in the House of Happiness. I needed more than an elephant. I needed to see you.</p> 
               
                <p>I do have some news for you. Bourbon Stonewall, the <del><unclear>more</unclear></del><add>more</add> than equine

                    stallion Alice raised and trained (beautiful, beautiful, <hi rend="double underline">and good</hi>) <hi rend="underline">won first place</hi> in the Stallion-and<del/>-Gelding Class at the State Fair in Sedalia this week. He won over a field of 15 horses, the best in this country, and against the top trainers &#8212; Art Simmons, <del><unclear>Sug</unclear></del><unclear>Sug</unclear> and Don Utz, the Higgenses, and Suttons! Alice, of course, rode him. She was rested and <hi rend="underline">in a good mood</hi>. So he just went out there and made a <hi rend="double underline">perfect</hi> show. Bourbon really has <hi rend="double underline">character</hi> in our human sense. He is a good man with a strong heart.</p>

                        <p>and here is more news. Lynn <hi rend="underline">won first</hi> in the 5-gaited Junior Class with our Prince Charming! We are hoping that Bourbon may win the great Five-Gaited Stake Friday night. It is the <hi rend="underline">top</hi> event and the competition is terrific and pitiless. They fight like mad men for that stake. Bourbon can <del>f<unclear/></del> fight 45 minutes if necessary. He did that in the Stallion-and-Gelding class, &amp; still was going like a mighty

                <p>I'm glad you have the Seymour letters from Knox College. Yes, our relationship was really <hi rend="underline">good</hi>. We kidded a lot because we felt affection. He was a huge, <del/> handsome but rather slow-moving man, weighing about 225 lbs in moderate flesh. He was head Accountant for the Pullman Company, and was top man in the Chicago office. <hi rend="underline">I owe him much, for real friendship when it was most useful</hi>.</p> 
               
                <p>He was gifted <del>in</del>

                    in verse-making, <del>and</del> and often composed clever things while shaving or bathing. Have you seen my article in Step-Fiddler about his death? If not, you should. We did feel something like love for each other. I kidded him when he was in process of dying, the day before he went, and he kidded back almost merrily. <hi rend="underline">We both knew</hi>. I can't recall the first time I met him, but it was in connection with the Bookfellows (his darling child).</p>

                <p>Here is more news! Old Hilda's <add>final</add> grade in her law course is 4.0! Isn't that bully? Her <hi rend="underline">average</hi> for 2 1/2 years is 3.5 &#8212; which, I believe, is an <hi rend="caps">A</hi>.</p>
             
                <p>And here I must record the shameful fact that my big-little dog, Jacquot, is a fightin' dog, and loves to tackle the big ones! Hilda has a half-breed German <choice><sic>Shepard</sic><corr>Shepherd</corr></choice> called "Twinkle" (like "Twinkle, twinkle little star.")

                    The other day, Jacquot and I were over there, and Jacquot actually called Twinkle some perfectly horrible <del/> names &#8212; like "Go to hell!", and such. That made bad trouble. But <del>my dog does not<add>doesn't</add> know</del> my dog does not know yet that he got trounced.

                <p>I'm glad the lady we lunched with liked me a bit. I liked her too. She seemed strong, competent, and <hi rend="underline">good</hi> &#8212; a real person. I do like to be liked; but if you like me, I won't even need an elephant.</p>
