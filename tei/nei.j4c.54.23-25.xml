   <salute>Dear Lucile:</salute>
</opener>
<p>I am greatly encouraged by your recent letter, as I understand from it that you will have a batch of manuscript to send to me before long. I have arrangements made for handling the material at once. Mr. Young is a retired high school teacher and a very active person. He will help me with the manuscript by reading to me and taking down my comments.</p>

<p>I am so sorry about your father. It is such a pity that he has to have such a struggle in getting to the other world. That's the only criticism I have of the Lord's business as he takes care of it. There surely should be a better way to exit.</p>

<p>I note, too, that you are actually near enough to the end of your long task to think of May as a possible time for submitting your work to the Press. Won't it be bully to see your book actually in print? And I know, Lucile, it will be a good book. Surely it has been a labor of love as well as of scholarship.</p>

<p>A Hungarian painter from Kansas City will be here three days this week to paint my portrait. He is a very remarkable person, and we are looking forward to having him here.</p>

<p>I have <choice><sic>hearl</sic><corr>heard</corr></choice> from Mr. Black of Denver University. He is not a professor, as I had supposed, but a graduate student 24 years old. I am glad he is a young man since he is the sort of man who can be interested in <hi rend="caps">THE DIVINE ENCHANTMENT</hi> and <hi rend="caps">THE MESSIAH</hi>.</p>

<p>I can't be sure that I will be able to come out to see you for the final check-up. If I can I will, you know that, and I will let you know reasonably soon. I have sent your letter on to Enid to see if she might be interested but I have little hope that she would be able to come, especially this time of year.</p>

<p> You may remember John G. Madden, who was a student at <hi rend="caps">M. U.</hi> when you were there. He was <del><unclear>my</unclear></del> one of my boys and he has remained almost passionately faithful to this old friend of his. He is <del/> a <add>reserve</add> Navy flyer, and <del/> he has taken me about &#8212; once in a Lear Jet (19 minutes from <hi rend="caps">K. C.</hi> to Lincoln). He insists that I let him know <hi rend="double underline">when</hi>  I want to go <hi rend="double underline">anywhere</hi> and he will

be on hand to take me there! I mentioned needing to see you, and he leaped at the idea &#8212; wanted to start next <del><unclear>morning</unclear></del>morning. He will take me to Eugene if it seems right for me to go. But there would have to be a co-pilot (government regulations) and <hi rend="underline">two</hi> men could not wait for me to be through talking with you; and I don't want to travel alone with my eyes.
