                <p>Answers to your questions:</p>
                
                <p>My work for the Minneapolis Journal appeared on my literary page while I was in Minneapolis; and after I went back to Bancroft, it all appeared in my weekly column. The only <hi rend="underline">editorial</hi> I wrote for the paper appeared on the Sunday Editorial Page and was entitled "Wanted a New Cervantes". This is the one old Jones admired, but did not understand until someone explained it to him some days late. I had done this editorial as a

                sample when he was about to make me a proposition for doing the whole sacred Sunday Editorial Page. It had been done by one Phillips (I believe) in New York. Incidentally that chap could sling a neat pen now and then. You <hi rend="underline">should</hi> know that editorial! It's a real Wow! I wanted a Cervantes to do his old stunt, but this time against another system. I did <hi rend="double underline">not</hi> get the sacred Editorial Page - for reasons that will be clear

                when you read the editorial!!</p>
                
                <p>When I wrote the <del>weekly</del> column from Bancroft and later from Branson, I wrote an installment each week. There was no question as to what would be printed. The column I wrote was always run <del/> as I sent it. I was furnishing <hi rend="underline">a column</hi>, and the column was used.</p> 
               
                <p>Yes, I received the paper regularly.</p>

                    <p>I wrote about books I chose to review.</p>
                
                <p>When you need to consider my Socialism of those days, first remember the condition of labor then, and, second, review <hi rend="underline">my statement</hi> <del>of So</del> regarding Socialism which I sent you soon after you went to Eugene. Bower said something to the effect that my statement was the best he knew. I <hi rend="underline">did</hi> know what I was talking about.</p>
                
                <p>I think I know how the term <hi rend="underline">Socialism</hi> affects you. I <unclear/>

                    I was (for a short while) working with Socialists, I had a suppressed feeling of repugnance for the ordinary Socialist <hi rend="underline">I have yet</hi>. As for Communists, I've known only one for certain, and I disliked him as a person very much. If you have any prejudice against professing "radicals", I'm afraid I share the prejudice heartily. And yet, we of that time who dreamed of a <del>happy</del> happier world were not essentially wrong. Since then a tremendous revolution has taken place (rather in <hi rend="underline">our</hi> direction of that old time!) And the revolution is still in progress<del/>

                    and gaining <add>in</add> momentum. My <hi rend="underline">Cry of the People</hi> deserves respect. It<del/> and <hi rend="underline">The Red Wind Comes</hi> were <del/>prophetic certainly. They were both done <hi rend="underline">before, long  before</hi>, the Czar was kicked out. <hi rend="underline">And</hi> there <hi rend="underline">is power</hi> in both. I am seeing the fulfillment of the prophecy, <hi rend="underline">and it saddens me</hi>. So much is lost, <del>that</del> or seems to be. I am no longer sorry for Labor (!), and I see the values for which I lived <del/> seemingly in danger

                    I'm afraid I never <hi rend="underline">was</hi> a "democrat" in the matter of our higher values - <hi rend="underline">only on the level of fundamental human need</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>On the Post-Dispatch I wrote an editorial about what was being done to our higher values, and I remarked that if the same were being done to our <hi rend="underline">material</hi> values, there would be machine guns stationed at <add>all</add> strategic points along our city streets! Even the Post-Dispatch <del/> would not run <hi rend="underline">that</hi> editorial,

I admire your skill in research - by which I mean I <hi rend="underline">wonder</hi> at it.

                    for this (altho', as you know, I don't like you very much, do I?)</p>
                
                <p>I am a bit troubled, perhaps unnecessarily, about the fact that we are nearing <del/> a strategic moment for the appearance of <hi rend="underline">a</hi> biography - <hi rend="underline">not</hi> the definitive one I believe you will publish when I'm "over there", bless you! There are only 220 copies of the new printing of the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> left, and these will go next semester. After that, the <hi rend="caps">U.</hi> of Neb.

                <p>I'll very soon receive a formal invitation to lecture at Calcutta University. The Head of <hi rend="underline"> the English Dept</hi> there wants me to live in his family while I'm there. I <hi rend="underline">may</hi> go. In my next I'll tell you more.</p>

                <p>My mother's view of the World War was, I'm sure, much like mine.

                <p>My TV course is on <hi rend="underline">closed</hi> circuit and is given to two sections. We'll do this again next semester by way of perfecting the permanent record (on videotape). I note that students coming out of class look <del>especiall</del>especially happy. Also, I hear epithets like "fabulous", "fascinating" "wonderful" and such wowish utterances., which I regard as favorable.</p>
