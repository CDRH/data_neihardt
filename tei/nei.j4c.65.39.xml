<salute>Dear Sandy:</salute>
</opener>
<p>That was one of the finest letters I have ever received, and I have received many fine ones. I don't see how I can qualify for your image of me, but I accept it because it is yours and perhaps I deserve some of it. I certainly hope so.</p>

<p>In the first place, I am delighted over the news of Christopher's safe arrival and I am looking forward to becoming acquainted with him. Here is a hearty handshake for him.</p>

<p>I am out of the hospital and back home at Youngs, but I am not well yet and as a matter of fact I feel that the letter I am dictating far from represents my feeling for you. I wish I could see you and have a good talk.</p>

<p>I am delighted to hear about your progress with the novel. How I do hope the book will find an enthusiastic publisher and will hit it right with the public</p>

<p>Your film on Oscar Howe excites me and I do wish I could see and hear it. Tell me more about it and the way it is being received. How fine it was that you had Price as the narrator.</p>

<p>As you know, Neihardt Day is celebrated at Bancroft on the first Sunday in August each year. I wish you could be there this year, and I wish it were possible to play Sigurd's tape for the assembled crowd. He made only one tape, one of which you have. Am I right? And if so, could a copy be made from your tape? Mr. Young has a very good player and I have thought it would be good to run Sigurd's tape for the assembled crowd. Let me know about this soon.</p>

<p>You did have a close shave with death and disaster, didn't you? And even so, It is thrilling to hear about.</p>

<p>I was making good progress on the second volume of my "autobiography" when I became sick. I was doing a good job when I was stopped. I was with Captain Grant Marsh in his pilot house on the Yellowstone, and he was telling me things that have not been told before. It's a pretty good story. I was moving toward the Curly incident and the fast trip down the Yellowstone in the Far West with a cargo of Reno's wounded.</p>

<p>I am writing a very poor letter, as I know, for I seem to be somebody else trying to be me.</p>
<closer>
<salute>Give your lady my very warm regards and be sure of my love for you. Your old friend,</salute>

<opener>(P.S.</opener> <p>Gaki woke up at three o'clock on the morning of June 13 with stabbing pains in his ribs and back. X-rays revealed that the seventh lumbar <del>i</del><add>v</add>ertebra had collapsed, bringing undue pressure involving the ribs and the abdominal area. It was very painful and has now been alleviated to some extent by the wear<del>i</del>ing <del>p</del><add>o</add>f a brace when out of bed. He has been home from the hospital since July 3.</p> <closer>&#8212; <signed>Myrtle Young</signed>
