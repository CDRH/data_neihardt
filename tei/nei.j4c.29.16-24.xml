                <p>The long, long enervating spell of hot weather is over, and school has begun. You know that I've thought of you as much as ever this letterless while. Now I'm back in the harness at the University, and it's refreshing, I can tell you. 
                    <hi rend="underline">Bless the young people! They are so dear</hi>. You know that last semester I had 176 in Epic America. Last Tuesday &amp; Wed. were registration days, but they told me

                    I needn't stay &#8212; they'd take care of my classes. I remarked to Dickinson, the new head of our department, that we'd probably have to make some more cards. He said he'd see to that. Students <hi rend="underline">came in bunches</hi> to register in Epic America! Dickinson had 30 more cards made, but there was a line of <del/> 30 or 40 students wanting to take the course!! Dickinson closed the course because he thought our room would not

                    hold anymore. Yesterday, Thursday, the class met, and a <del/><add>number</add> of students came to me, asking if they could possibly be admitted. I then saw Dickinson. He was reluctant, but willing to go along with us. So God knows how many we'll have! Maybe we will be compelled to <unclear>hunt</unclear> an<add>other</add> auditorium. This is the end of the 12th year for <hi rend="underline">Epic America</hi>, and <hi rend="underline">it is more popular</hi>

                <p>My poetry class is bully. Fine young people who seem really interested and intelligent. I have 10 in the class. Would not take more.</p>
                
                <p>I'm giving you news. The Westerners (New York "posse") want me to talk to them at their annual dinner in mid-Oct. The program committee <add>evidently</add> did not know that I was one of the

They will pay all expenses, flight fare etc. This should go well with my engagement at Cornell University on Oct. 19. (I'll be talking to classes on the 17th and 18th also).

                        Westerners can have me on either the 14th or 21st of Oct., it will be swell.</p>
                
                <p>I do wish we could  be together for much needed talks on biographical matters. We've had a few talks, but they were rather sketchy, altho' even so, they helped a lot. I must begin making brief notes of all matters that occur to me. I was much impressed by the way you have arranged your notes. It's most remarkable if I am still in this world when you are writing the biography.

                        could help, no end, by checking details, suggesting changes, helping to build the necessary mood of the <del/> situation. Maybe this can be so to some degree. <add>(I hope to see you, Xmas.)</add></p>
                
                <p>It's strange about the television program. Lambert, (who is the president's assistant for television) said recently that my course was the best they ever had. Twice he was tried to have it repeated. We had even made extensive plans for a course limited to the Wars &amp; the Messiah (with Sioux culture).

                        Each time Hudson stymied the matter. Why? (Hilda said to me slyly, "Dad, could you have been a bit too successful?" &#8212;!!). <note type="authorial">H. is very friendly to me  and he may be to blame.</note></p> 
                
                <p>I really never go to town but someone stops me and talks about my television courses both <hi rend="underline">whites</hi> and 
                    <hi rend="underline">negroes</hi>. Today a man stopped and said, "You don't know me, but I just <hi rend="underline">loved</hi> your television program." There have been hundreds of people who have talked to me about the <del/> course,

                    and asked if I'd be on again soon. Perhaps it doesn't matter &#8212; I suspect it doesn't much &#8212; <hi rend="underline"> but what the deuce</hi>?!?!</p>
                
                <p>Lady, <hi rend="underline">dear</hi> lady! You mean very much to this old man, because you are very important in the Pattern, and <hi rend="underline">because you are you, also</hi>. I'm so glad you <add>can</add> feel, as you do; about the <hi rend="underline">life</hi>. You will do a very fine, sensitive, and illuminating job, for you know your task is to reveal values.

                    worth doing, very much so. This thing is <hi rend="underline">not</hi> dying; it is already among the enduring things and cannot be rubbed out. Fancy, for instance, any of the touted modernistic "poets" holding large classes of students with their "poetry" through, semester after semester!! Fancy them holding any crowd, sophisticated or roughneck, as the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> has done and can do anywhere anytime!! <note type="authorial">&#8212;or the lyrics!</note></p>

                    write anything to you. So I am bold enough to write what I know, being sure you will not regard me as merely egotistic. By god, dear lady, as you have so often said &#8212; <del/><add>and</add> in your latest &#8212; there <hi rend="underline">is</hi> impersonal

                    drop out, either by retiring from the job, or from this world, and they don't want to miss the course. This could well be, as it certainly seems to me.</p>
                
                <p>Alice's partner, Mr. Cook, was thrown by a new mare day before yesterday &#8212; a big, powerful mare. It was a great exhibition of "riding 'em rough" but Cook finally <unclear/> out. The mare herself fell to the right when Cook went hurtling to the left. He has a broken collarbone &amp; is badly shaken <del><unclear>up</unclear></del> up, but he will be all right.

                        In the meanwhile, Alice has a greatly increased burden, but we'll have some way of solving the problem, Alice is very courageous, and does not worry. She is quite a gal. Cook is in the hospital &#8212; for perhaps a week.</p>
