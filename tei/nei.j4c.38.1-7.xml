                </opener>
                <p>I've been waiting for your next before telling you about the Historical Society dinner at Lincoln; but I don't want to let the news grow too stale, so I'm writing now.</p>
                
                <p>The affair was a big <hi rend="underline">Wow</hi>! People came from every corner of the state &#8212; because I was announced, I'm told. The ball-room of the Cornhusker Hotel was jammed with tables &amp; people, and there was an <hi rend="underline">electric feel</hi> in the place. My party arrived a bit late, and when we entered there was a "standing ovation" and how they <hi rend="double underline">did</hi>

                    welcome the Little Buffalo! Loud and long!! The introduction was given by Mr. Latenser, a distinguished architect of Omaha, who knew me in the great, hopeful days when Vinsonhaler was living and still <del>by</del><add>my</add> dear friend. It was a fine, well-wrought speech, giving the history of my life rapidly, and ending somewhat thus. (The way he said it &amp; how he introduced it was really clever. I miss something here.) He said: "In 1492 Columbus discovered America,

                        in 1881, John Neihardt was born. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you John Neihardt" (Words to that effect, but <hi rend="underline">really</hi> effective as given).</p>
                
                <p>I spoke about Black Elk for 1 hr. 15 mins &#8212; off the cuff &#8212; no notes. It went smoothly &#8212; flowed, and in spots could not fail to be beautiful. When I ceased, there was another rising ovation and a clamor that lasted until I stopped it. Afterwards,

                        people crowded around for a half hour or more. It <hi rend="underline">was</hi> a joy. Mrs. Winkleman said she would write you and send a program (with the bronze bust on it.)</p>
                
                <p>Well, I miss your letters! It seems long since you wrote, altho' it is hardly 3 weeks.</p>
                
                <p>I talked with Nicoll of the Nebraska University Press &#8212; the top man. He is very eager to bring out the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> in paper, and will begin as soon as I have made my peace with Macmillans.

                    He wants to publish a volume of Lyrics and Dramas, also, but thinks they should appear after the Cycle, I strongly disagree, and so do others in Lincoln with whom I talked. I wish <hi rend="underline">you</hi> could talk to him &#8212; or maybe <hi rend="underline">write</hi>.</p>
                
                <p>Now listen!</p>
                
                <p>Nicoll said, with special emphasis, "I want to ask a special favor of you. Please intercede with Dr. Lucile Aly in the matter of the biography. <hi rend="underline">We want</hi>

                    <hi rend="underline">to publish that book</hi>!" So I'm interceding, you see!</p>
                
                <p>I think if they <unclear>knew</unclear> enough, they'd plan to bring out most of my out-of-print work in a series. They <hi rend="underline">should</hi>, and it would sell. If you write Nicoll, you might want to make the suggestion.</p>
                
                <p><hi rend="underline">I</hi> think the <hi rend="underline">Cycle</hi> should be published in two volumes. The first would be called <hi rend="underline">A Cycle</hi>
