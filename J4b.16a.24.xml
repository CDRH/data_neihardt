My dear Mr. Neihardt:
<p>We are glad, indeed, that your father is able to come on Monday night date. Our plans for receiving him have not entirely worked out, but if you will notify us the approximate time of his arrival, I shall be glad to help him get settled. We are eagerly anticipating his visit and hope the present, difficult weather conditions will be greatly improved by next week.</p>
Very sincerely yours,
